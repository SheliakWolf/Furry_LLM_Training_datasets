"请以学术的语言续写：The evolution of galaxies over cosmic time is largely determined by their mass growth and is thus connected to their environment and their merger rate. It is well observed that the mix of morpho- logical types of galaxies depends on the environment (Dressler 1980; Whitmore et al.1993). The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a well-suited diagnostic to characterise their evolution- ary state. Galaxies can, on the one hand, enhance their star for- mation rate through interaction with their environment (Bothun & Dressler1986; Pimbblet et al.2002), but, on the other hand, they can also be quenched by the environment (Balogh et al. 1998). Isolated galaxies are thought to refuel their discs with gas from extended halos and from cosmic ?laments, while galaxies located in massive clusters will evolve passively (Balogh et al. 1998). The assembly and growth of galactic discs and galaxies in general are some of the key issues of galaxy simulations (e.g. Mo et al.1998). Accretion from ?laments is motivated bynumeri- cal simulations (e.g.Bond et al.1996), while observational detec- tion is based on ?laments of galaxies in cluster environments (e.g. Laigle et al.2018; Sarron et al.2019) and the Lyα forest tomography (e.g. Lee et al.2018). The latter approach is the only one that directly detects so-called gas accretion.","The identi?cation of merging galaxies is usually based on morphology (e.g. Lotz et al. 2004) or detection of dynami- cally close pairs (e.g. De Propris et al.2005). Relying on the latter technique, Ellison et al. (2008) identi?ed 1716 galaxies with companions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR) 4 with stellar mass ratios between 0:1 < M1 /M2 < 10. Further studies of this sample found that star formation due to galaxy interactions can be triggered in low-to-intermediate density environments (Ellison et al.2010). By extending their search to SDSS DR7, they increased their sample to 21 347 galaxy pairs and found evidence for a central starburst induced by galaxy interactions (Patton et al.2011). By including quasi stellar objects (QSO) in their search, Ellison et al.(2011b) found that active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity can occur well before the ?nal merging of a galaxy pair and is accompanied by ongo- ing star formation."

But earlier steps have been explored, and several dual AGNs, which is a late stage of a galaxy merger (Genzel et al.2001;Koss et al.2016,2018;Goulding et al.2019), or even a triple nucleus (Deane et al.2014;Pfei?e et al.2019), have been detected.

The possible correlations between the gamma-ray emission at 1 GeV and the radio emission at 8.4 GHz is investigated. Main results as follows： for minimum gamma-ray data, there is no correlations between the gamma-ray and radio flux density, for the maximum and average data, there were good correlations between the gamma-ray and radio emissions. So, the gamma-ray emission is the SSC process, the radio emission, especially in the high frequence, is important to the gamma-ray emission."

The correlations between two flux densities of the radio 1.4 GHz and gamma-ray at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 GeV are investigated for the samples of all blazars, FSRQs, BL Lacs, and subclasses of HBLs and LBLs, respectively. Results show that there are strong positive correlations between the two flux densities, with the correlation coefficients r = 0.48-0.81 and the chance probabilities p all less than 10-4; The correlation coefficient has different trends with the change of gamma-ray emission frequency for different blazar samples, and the average correlation coefficients for all samples at the five respective bands decrease with the increase of gamma-ray frequency. Therefore, with the increase of gamma-ray frequency, the dominant mechanism of gamma-ray radiation of blazar is changing, and at the same frequency the dominant mechanism is different for different samples. The gamma-ray emission of HBLs may be mainly dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton, while the other mechanisms are responsible for the gamma-ray emissions of LBLs. The origin of gamma-ray in FSRQs is more complex than that of BL Lacs."

Multi-timescale and multi-band variability is a characteristic observational feature of AGNs. In particular, X-ray variability is most worth noting because of being intense and rapid, as well as carrying rich physical information of the innermost region of the accretion disk. Therefore, AGN X-ray variability has long been used as a probe for studying SMBHs. However, at present, we still lack a very fundamental understanding of AGN X-ray variability, whose origin and mechanisms remain largely unclear. The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite has an unprecedented soft X-ray survey capability, with a grasp (i.e., the product of detector effective area and field of view) being one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous similar satellites. EP is able to monitor hundreds of bright AGNs in the whole sky with sampling intervals ranging from 100 s to years, and will thereby build an exceptional AGN variability database. Accordingly, we propose to carry out AGN investigations mainly in the following four aspects: comprehensive measurement of the soft X-ray power spectral density for a large sample of bright AGNs; systematic monitoring and study of the rare large-amplitude AGN X-ray variability and flaring phenomenon; examination of long-term spectral variability for a large sample of AGNs and monitoring of their outbursts; and AGN/ quasar survey. These unprecedented data will facilitate our further understanding of many scientific questions, such as the intense AGN X-ray variability and flaring phenomenon and its mechanisms, the physical conditions, structures, dynamics, and radiation processes of the AGN accretion disk, jet, and corona, as well as the AGN cosmological evolution. Furthermore, given EPs capability of exploring a brand-new discovery space (large sky-area, long-timescale, and systematic soft X-ray monitoring), we are likely to discover some black hole accretion phenomena never seen before the complexity and diversity of the Universe are always beyond human imagination."

They have significant values in studying the origin of the supermassive BHs in high-redshift quasars (namely the seed BHs problem) and the astronomical sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. The number of broad-line IMBH AGN in the local universe, owing to the great development of large-scale optical spectroscopic surveys, has been more than 500. For those optically selected IMBH AGN, the radio studies based on the VLA FIRST survey data and follow-up radio continuum observations of individuals and small samples, have obtained meaningful results already. This article reviews the progresses in the field of radio continua of IMBH AGN, detailed in the following 4 aspects: the radio morphology, continuum slope, radio power and loudness, and fundamental plane of BH activity. Moreover, preparing for the ongoing large-scale continuum surveys as SKA pathfinder projects (eg, VLASS and EMU) and for the SKA era 10 years later (SKA1 at least), we prospect the achievable goals for IMBH AGNs in the pathfinder and SKA eras respectively. Besides, aiming to find low-redshift IMBH AGN out of such a huge number of sources that would be detected by SKA, we analyze and present an optimal strategy of the followup identification (eg, optical spectroscopy for redshifts) for those purely radio-selected sources."
"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：活动星系核的能量反馈是星系形成理论模型中的一个重要物理过程,与星系所处的暗物质晕质量、星系中央大质量黑洞吸积率等因素有关。当前的半解析模型预测活动星系核反馈机制主要有两种模式:射电模式和类星体模式,前者主要发生在大质量暗晕中央的大质量星系中,后者主要由较小质量星系并合导致。利用斯隆数字化巡天(SDSS)提供的目前最大的类星体光谱观测样本,结合基于SDSS构建的星系群(团)表,从统计上分析了类星体的热光度和暗晕质量的分布情况。初步分析结果显示,在大质量暗晕中,类星体的热光度和所在暗晕的质量没有相关性,类星体所在暗晕的质量分布很广,进一步证实了高光度的类星体并不存在于大质量的暗晕中。","AGN feedback is an important process in the galaxies forming theory, which is related to the mass of the dark matter halo where the galaxy dwell in and the accretion rate of the black hole in the center of the galaxy. There are two modes of the AGN feedback in the semi analysis model: radio mode and quasar mode. The former mainly takes place in the massive dark matter halos, and the later mainly takes place in the low-mass dark matter halos. We use the largest quasar sample and group catalogs which are all extracted from the SDSS observation to study the relation between the quasars and dark matter halos. The preliminary results show that the bolometric luminosity of quasars is independent of the halo mass which is consistent with the previous results and quasars reside in a broad range of host halos, We further prove that the most luminous quasar do not live in the most massive halo."

"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：黑洞是广义相对论理论预言的天体,也是很多天文现象,如类星体、活动星系核、喷流、吸积盘的中心引擎。根据广义相对论,宇宙中的黑洞可以由质量和自旋两个参数来描述。对比黑洞质量的测定,自旋的测量较为困难。但自旋的方向与很多天文现象密切相关。如果黑洞自旋方向与吸积盘的转动方向一致,将形成正向吸积的天文现象;反之,如果黑洞自旋的与吸积盘的转动方向相反,将形成逆向吸积的天文现象。利用宽线区尺度与光学光度之间的关系,最近的研究发现了逆向吸积盘的可能候选体。利用双黑洞并合的物理图像提出了一种逆向吸积盘的物理形成机制,并定量计算了相关的逆向吸积盘形成率。发现了超大质量双黑洞系统的质量比分布与类星体逆向吸积盘的形成率之间存在定量关系,该定量关系可以通过未来的空间引力波探测以及逆向吸积盘的探测进行检验。","Black holes are objects predicted by general relativity theory.Black holes are also the central engines of many astronomical phenomena,including quasars,active galactic nuclei,jets,accretion disks and so on.General relativity indicates that black holes in the universe can be described by two parameters:mass and spin.Compared with the measurement of black holes mass,spin measurement is more difficult.However,the direction of spin is closely related to many astronomical phenomena.If the spin of a black hole coincides with the rotation direction of the accretion disk,a positive accretion disk will be formed;if the spin of a black hole is opposite to the rotation direction of the accretion disk,a reverse accretion astronomical phenomenon will be formed.The continuum spectrum fitting method and the ferrography method are widely used in the spin measurement for black holes.No plausible candidates for the reverse accretion disk have been found by these methods.However,recent studies have identified potential candidates for reverse accretion disks based on the analysis of the relationship between the responsivity weighted radius of the broad line region and optical luminosity (R-L relation).In this paper,a physical mechanism of reverse accretion disks formation is proposed based on the physical picture of the black hole mergers.And we have calculated the relative formation rates of reverse accretion disks.Interestingly,we find a quantitative relationship between the mass ratio distribution of supermassive binary black hole systems and the formation rate of quasar retrograde accretion disks.This quantitative relationship can be tested by future gravitational wave detection through space-based detectors and retrograde accretion disk detection."

"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：阻尼莱曼alpha吸收线系统(DLAs)是中性氢柱密度超过2xl0~20 cm~-2的类星体吸收线系统. 按照现有的观点, DLAs是高红移环境中星系及恒星形成的中性气体库, 它们很可能是现今星系的前身. 近20年来随着DLAs巡天观测的迅猛发展, 尤其是SDSS巡天观测数据的释放, DLAs统计样本达到千计的量级, 大大推动了DLAs的观测和研究. 由于受到观测的某些限制, 样 本还有偏, 尤其是缺少低红移DLAs, 但是, 通过大样本DLAs系统的研究, 已经获得了有关宇宙 中性气体演化的许多信息, 如DLAs的数密度在高红移处(z>1.5)是有演化的, 但在低红移处基 本不演化, 从而确认了今天的星系形成于较高红移处. 研究也发现DLAs对宇宙质量密度的贡献 随红移的演化减弱, DLAs的中性氢气体柱密度分布函数与本地星系的中性氢柱密度分布函数十 分相似等一些有趣的结论. 着重介绍DLAs的基本知识以及20年来巡天的有关进展, 包括DLAs 的观测证认、统计特性等, 并指出目前DLAs样本不完备的主要原因","Damped Lyman a Absorption systems (DLAs) are high column density gaseous systems (lg(NH I) >20.2), detected through their absorption lines in the optical spectra of quasars at up to relatively high redshifts(-5). They are regarded as the reservoirs of neutral gas in the Universe. Their study constitutes a powerful means to investigate the properties of distant galaxies and intergalactic medium (IGM). In this first one of the two review papers, we give a detailed introduction to the recent progress in DLAs surveys. The next will review the results and progress in cosmic abundances of chemical elements and galactic evolution based on DLAs surveys and researches. The first systematic search for DLAs was done by Wolfe et al. in 1986. This Lick survey has found 15 systems at a mean redshift of 2.5 along the line of sight of 68 QSOs. Later, a series of surveys found more DLAs absorbers, but most of them are biased towards high redshifts since surveys at low and intermediate redshifts are difficult due to the lack of UV observations. In the recent years, the number of DLAs has increased substantially, especially from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). After mining the thousands of QSOs spectra from SDSS, Prochaska et al. and Noterdaeme et al. have found 738 and 937 DLAs respectively, increasing by one order of magnitude the number of known DLAs. The large sample of DLAs has statistically derived and/or confirmed some important results about the properties of neutral gas evolution across the cosmic time. One of the important quantities of DLAs from these surveys is the frequency distribution function f (N, H I). Early surveys show that this function can be described by a power law. But recent large sample surveys show that the slope of f (N, H I) is much larger at high column density (lg(NH I) >21.5). The whole shape can be well fitted by a double power law or Gammafunction. The large slope at high column density implies that the systems at large neutral column density are rare. On the other hand, the shapes of f (N, H I) for different redshits are similar. This invariant suggests that the DLAs might not consume the gas according to th e classical Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law and that the accretion of gas into existing H I galaxies must be balanced by the consumption of gas into stars and its removal from galaxies. DLAs contain most of the neutral gas in the Universe at 0 < z <5.0.

"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：暗能量和暗物质是21世纪基础物理学研究中的两个重大科学问题.在观测上,暗能量与暗物质存在的相互作用可以在大尺度上影响宇宙学距离,这为通过高红移宇宙学探针间接探测该相互作用提供了可能性.在理论上,引入暗能量与暗物质的相互作用有助于缓解标准宇宙学模型(LambdaCDM模型)的巧合性问题,并为研究暗物质粒子的性质带来新的方法.本文使用类星体在多波段的最新观测数据(X射线和紫外波段类星体作为宇宙标准烛光、致密射电类星体作为宇宙标准直尺)(0.04 <5.1),结合最新的重子声学振荡观测结果(0.38 <2.34)对多种相互作用暗能量模型(gamma_dIDE模型、gamma_mIDE模型)和其他宇宙学模型(LambdaCDM模型、XCDM模型)进行了高精度观测检验,并对暗能量与暗物质间可能的相互作用、暗物质粒子的质量区间进行了定量分析.结果显示,(1)多波段类星体数据可以将相互作用暗能量模型参数限制得更加紧密,从而进一步证实了类星体作为标准探针应用到宇宙学研究中的巨大潜力.(2)在gamma_mIDE模型和gamma_dIDE模型的框架下,多波段类星体数据都支持高红移处暗能量转化为暗物质的可能性,从而在一定程度上缓解了巧合性问题.同时,我们发现表征暗物质与暗能量相互作用强度的值非常小,这表明暗能量与暗物质间的相互作用强度非常弱.(3)LambdaCDM模型是与多波段类星体数据符合得最好的宇宙学模型.在该模型的框架下,宇宙中物质的密度参数为Omega_m = 0.317_(-0.007)~(+0.007),哈勃常数为H0 = 68.177+0.497-0.505(68.3%的置信区间).该结果与普朗克卫星对微波背景辐射(CMB)的最新测量符合得很好.(4)假设宇宙中的暗物质以拥有Z2对称性的实标量暗物质的形式存在,结合多波段类星体对暗能量-暗物质耦合系数的限制,可以将暗物质粒子的质量区间确定为56 GeV ? mS ? 63 GeV或mS ? 450 GeV.该结果与直接探测暗物质实验给出的最新测量保持一致.","Dark energy and dark matter,two subjects of basic physics,have received a lot of attention in the 21st century.From the observational point of view,the interaction between dark energy and dark matter can significantly affect cosmological distances.This gives rise to the possibility of indirectly detecting such interaction through high-redshift cosmological probes.Theoretically,the introduction of interaction between dark energy and dark matter can assist in alleviating the coincidence problem of the standard cosmological model (LambdaCDM model).Furthermore,this can provide a new method of studying the properties of dark matter particles.In this paper,based on the latest observations of multiple measurements of quasars (Xray+ UV quasars acting as standard candles,compact radio quasars acting as standard rulers) covering the redshift range of 0.04 <5.1 and baryonic acoustic oscillation between (0.38 <2.34),we investigate the observational constraints on a variety of interacting dark energy models (gamma_dIDE model,gamma_mIDE model) and other cosmological models (LambdaCDM model,XCDM model).The results provide us with a quantitative analysis of the possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter,as well as the possible range of the mass of dark matter particles.The joint analysis shows that:(1) Multiple measurements of quasars can provide more stringent constraints on the interacting dark energy models,which can further strengthen the potential of quasars acting as effective cosmological standard probes at higher redshifts;(2) In the framework of both gamma_mIDE model and gamma_dIDE model,the quasar data supports possible conversion of dark energy into dark matter at high redshift,which alleviates the coincidence problem to some extent.We also found that the interaction term is of a small value,which demonstrates the negligible interaction between dark matter and dark energy;(3) In the framework of LambdaCDM model,which has shown the best consistency with quasar data,the density parameter of matter in the Universe is constrained at Omega_m = 0.317_(-0.007)~(+0.007),with the best-fit Hubble constant H0 = 68.177+0.497-0.505 at 68.3% confidence level.These findings are consistent with the recent microwave background radiation (CMB) measurements from the Planck satellite;(4) If dark matter in the Universe exists in the form of scalar-field dark matter with Z2 symmetry,we obtain the range of the mass of dark matter particles as 56 GeV ? mS ? 63 GeV or mS ? 450 GeV,based on the dark energy-dark matter coupling term from multiple measurements of quasars.Such conclusions agree well with the latest experimental results aimed at the direct detection of dark matter particles."
"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：2008年秋天,3C 454.3在gamma射线能段和光学波段呈现出非常大的爆发,在这次爆发过程中Fermi/LAT和SMARTS都对其进行了观测.通过对,gamma射线能段与SMARTS J及B波段在这次大爆发期间获得的光变数据进行细致的DCF分析发现:这段时期内3C 454.3的J波段光变落后,gamma射线光变大约2d.在进行相关性分析过程中,对DCF做了稍许改进,得到一种改进的 DCF-时间变换的离散相关函数(TDCF).TDCF的峰值在gamma=-1.66 d,无论是对TDCF取重心还是用非对称的高斯函数拟合,其结果都显示3C 454.3的J波段光变落后gamma射线光变大约2 d.FR/RSS Monte Carlo模拟结果也显示gamma射线领先近红外(光学)光变.如果这个延时是由于电子辐射冷却产生的,那么逆康普顿散射的种子光子能量不能大于1.1 eV.这个延时也可能是由于辐射区域的大小不同引起的,2d的延时反映了两个波段辐射区域的几何性质.高能与低能波段光变有较强的相关性证明这两个波段的辐射是由同一辐射区域产生的:gamma射线辐射来自于辐射区域的内部,近红外辐射来自于包括gamma射线辐射区域在内的更大区域.由于近红外的辐射区域大于gamma射线辐射区域,引起光变的相对论激波传播到整个近红外辐射区域比传播到整个gamma射线辐射区域所用的时间长;因此,观测到了J,波段光变落后7射线光变的现象.通过结构函数分析得到的两个波段的光变时标相差约2.5 d,这与大约2d的延时符合得很好","Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) is a powerful tool to analyze correlation between two sets. A kind of the progressive DCF technique, time-transformed DCF (TDCF), is used to analyze time lag between variations of gamma-ray and J or B bands for 3C 454.3. The TDCFs of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray vs SMARTS J and B bands light curves both peak at gamma=-1.66 days. This implies that y-ray variations lead the J band ones by about 2 days. The period of the data is from JD-2 454 710 to JD=2 454 770. Considering the effects of flux errors and sampling characteristics,FR,RSS and the combined of them are used to Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the time lags and the uncertainties. The simulations show that the y-rays lead the J band emission. Thus it is reliable that the gamma-rays lead the J band emission. The time lag might be due to the cooling time-scale of electrons' synchrotron and Compton radiations. In this case, the energy of 'seed' photons couldn't be higher than l.1 eV. The time lag also might be related to the different sizes of their emission regions. The strong correlation of the two variations indicates that the gamma-rays and the J band emission are emitted from 'the same region. As a shock spreads in the region,it first influences the whole gamma-ray emission region. At this time, the y-ray flux reaches its maximum value. The inner gamma-ray emission region is only a part of the NIR emission region. Thus the NIR flux has not reached its maximum value as the gamma-rays reach the maximum. As the shock spreads the whole NIR emission region,a few days later, the NIR fiux reaches its maximum. Time-scale of variations indicates the size of an emission region. The structure functions show that the timescale of the J band variations is larger than that of the gamma-rays, about 2 days. This timescale difference of about 2 days is consistent with the time lag of the J band emission relative to the gamma-rays. This agreement supports the above explanation of the time lag. Around JD≌2 454 712, both the gamma-rays and the optical B band emission show their minimum flux, which also supports the above explanation"

An overview of our current understanding of the interstellar extinction laws of the MilkyWay (MW) and external galaxies is presented. In the MW, the extinction law in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical can be characterized by a one-parameter function of RV = AV=E(B - V); the near-infrared (IR) extinction law appears to be an approximately uniform power law of A_lambda ~(lambda-alpha); an universal flat extinction law is found in the mid-IR (3 ~ 8 mum). In the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the extinction curve rises steeply in the UV and lacks the 2 175 A bump in the bar region. However, in the SMC wing region, the extinction curve rises less steeply in the UV and the 2 175 A bump is present. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the average extinction is intermediate between that of the MW and SMC. The 2 175 A bump in the star-forming regions of LMC 30 Dor and supershell LMC 2 is much weaker than that of the MW. For M31, the extinction curve resembles that of the MW. The attenuation laws of high redshift galaxies and the extinction laws of M33, M101, NGC 2207, M82, type Ia supernovae, starburst galaxies, quasars, and active galactic nucleus are also disscussed."

We used the IRAM-30m telescope to observe CO emission lines in nine DBQs at 0.5 < z < 3, and detected nine lines at different transitions in eight sources. Five lines are strong detections, and four lines are tentative detections. According to the CO line-width versus line luminosity diagram, seven sources satisfy the unlensed/slightly-lensed relation, while one is likely to be strongly lensed by a factor of about 12. With lensing-corrected infrared luminosities from the literature and SED fitting, we estimate their star formation rates to be approximately 40 ~ 3 500M_⊙・a~(-1), and the gas depletion time to be approximately 20 ~ 300 Ma. Their star formation efficiency shows no significant difference from other SMGs and QSOs comparing their IR and CO luminosities. We find a negative correlation between AGN relative strength and gas depletion time, which is consistent with the QSO evolutionary model."

Wang(2008)提出一种新的、由AGN的辐射反馈驱动的gamma射线辐射过程,辐射的能量峰值落在1GeV-0.1TeV之间,光度典型值达到10~(42)-10~(43)ergs s~(-1).射电宁静类星体中的这种辐射过程使得它们成为潜在的gamma辐射源,并对gamma背景产生贡献.考虑逆康普顿散射的种子光子分别来自类星体吸积盘和宇宙微波背景这两种情况,发现前一种情况在～1GeV处贡献了78%-92%的背景辐射强度,后一种情况的贡献可以忽略.射电宁静类星体很可能成为对1GeV附近,gamma射线背景贡献最大的天体.","EGRET has updated the value of the diffusedgamma-ray background which is confused in origin.Meanwhile,it has revealed a population ofgamma-ray sources with no radio counterparts which are isotropically distributed in the sky,and probably with cosmological origins.Wang(2008) has proposed a newgamma-ray radiation scenario driven by AGN feedback. The radiation peaks around 1GeV0.1TeV with a typical luminosity of 10~(42)10~(43)ergs s~(-1). This scenario makes radio quiet quasars potentialgamma-ray sources as well as contributors togamma-ray background.Photons from disks of quasars or CMB photons are scattered by electrons in inverse-Compton(IC) processes.Radiation from the former process takes up 78%92% of thegamma-ray background around 1GeV,while radiation from the later process is negligible. Thus radio quiet quasars are likely to be the most important contributors to thegamma-ray background around 1GeV."

Therefore, it is essential to investigate the gamma-ray variability. VLBI is the unique method to resolve Blazars on pc scale, thus the combination of gamma-ray and radio studies would promote the localization of the gamma-ray emission region and other research on jet properties. In particular, the connections between gamma-ray flares and ejections of radio components have been found in a number of Blazars, for example, OJ 287, PKS 1510-089, Mrk 421, 3C 454.3, etc. However, there are also contradictions in previous studies, such as whethergamma-ray or radio leads, so further analyses and research are required.In this paper, the Fermi-LAT data from 5 August 2008 to 23 October 2013 has been used to investigate the gamma-ray properties of 4C 21.35 between 100 MeV and 300 GeV. Specifically, the variability properties with 1-day time bins have been summaried, and 11 chosen marked bursts have been analysed in detail with 3-hour time bins. The shortest variability time scale we have got is 5.4 hours. We also use the method of subtracting a linear increase from the original radio light curve, and then correlation analysis concludes that the gamma-ray variations lead the 15 GHz radio variations by 351:2_(-38.0)~(+13:8) days. The radio opacity in the gamma-ray emission region is used to interpret the delay, and the distance between the gamma-ray emission region and the region becoming transparent in radio band, ?r44:4 pc has been obtained provided that the emission region is in uniform motion. Then by comparing it with the radio core radius obtained by VLBA, a decelarating inner jet is likely to exist."

请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：本文综述了活动星系核，特别是blazar天体的研究现状，对blazar天体的多波段与多波段能谱特性研究进行了较为详细的评述。主要的研究工作包括以下内容：（一）gamma噪blazar天体的短时标光变研究，通过对16个gamma噪blazar天体（其中包括全部已证认和观测到VHEgamma射线爆发的可能甚高能gamma射线源）自1998年的光学观测及光变分析研究表明，短时标光变（小时量级）是GeV gamma噪blazar天体的普遍特性，光变幅度通常可达0.6mag/h，对PKS 1510－089类星体的观测发现在一个小时内对象变暗2个星等，对如此激烈的光变变暗目前的理论还不能很好的解释，但它同样反映了辐射区域的内部结构；而对TBLs的监测表明，其光学波段的短时标光变没有其他对象激烈，出现的频度和振幅变化都较小；（二）在研究gamma噪blazar天体光变时，研究了寄主星系对光变的影响，得到了1ES 2344+514的光变与PSF的FWHM的关联，表明随着大气视宁度的下降（即FWHM变大），对象变暗，即由于寄主星系的影响从而导致假光变的产生；（三）引进两个多波段复合谱指数，alphaXOX=alphaOX-alphaX及alphaoro=alphaor-alphao。对样本的统计研究表明，RBLs是能谱特性界于XBLs和OVVs之间的一类中间态，所得结果支持了Sambruna et al.（1996）大样本多波段能谱分布特性的统计研究结果；（四）对地面探测器对blazar天体甚高能波段的观测做了较为详细的了解，由于blazar天体在全波段上都观测到光变，所以这类对象是多波段观测研究最完全的。地面望远镜对小时量级的光变很敏感，所以，对低流量源的直到10TeV或更高能谱的测量是多波段研究的重要扩展，特别是，如果gamma射线的幅射是通过康谱顿散射提升低能同步辐射光子产生的，即SSC模型产生，那么，VHEgamma射线的观测和低能同步辐射的观测就可能估计喷流内的磁场强度、Doppler因子等。对我们今后的光学波段的观测工作提出了新的课题。,"In the present thesis, the basic properties and research results about the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are reviewed. It is focused on the multiband observation and the properties of multiband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars that would constraint the emission models of blazars. Our main work and results are as follows. (1) studying on the short timescale variability of gamma- ray blazars. Our CCD monitoring campaign form 1998 has monitored 16 gamma- ray blazars, including all the TeV sources and some suspicious TeV objects. The observational results show that the short timescale (about 1 hour) variability is the common property for the GeV gamma- ray blazars, and the amplitude variation in each optical band (B, V, R, I) could reach to 0.6 mag/hour. The Gev gamma- ray - loud source, PKS 1510-089, was very active during our observation period, and it shoed an apparent variation of 2.0 mag within 41 minutes in the R band. This is the most violently rapid variability in the optical monitoring program since 1982. For this rapid dimming variability phenomenon, there is not any suitable theoretical explanation so far, however, this is the reflection of emission region structure. As for the TeV gamma- ray blazars, the short timescale variability in the optical band is less drastic than GeV gamma- ray blazars in both the amplitude and timescale; (2) The influence of variable seeing conditions on the observations was investigated. There is weak correlation between the observed variability and the local seeing conditions for the objects 1ES 2344 + 514. This implies that the source brightness decreased, while the FWHM of PSF increased, removing more light from the aperture, i. e. there would be some spurious variation influenced by variable seeing conditions. (3) The two composite color - color indices alpha_(xox) = alpha_(ox) - alpha_x and alpha_(oro) = alpha_(or) - alpha_o are introduced. The statistical results for the selected samples show that the RBLs are intermediate between the XBLs and the OVV quasars as suggested by Sumbruna et al. (1996). (4)The overview of the VHE gamma- ray observations by using the ground based Cerenkov imaging telescope and other detectors is presented. Because of their variability at all wavelengths, blazars can be well understood through the multi - wavelength observations. The sensitivity of the VHE telescopes to the sub - hour scale variability, and their ability to detect how source fluxes, as well as the spectral measurement up to 10 TeV or more make the VHE observations an important addition to the multi - wavelength campaigns. In particular, if the gamma- ray emission arises from inverse Compton scattering of the same electron population which produces the low energy synchrotron emission, the combination of VHE gamma- ray and synchrotron observations permit the estimation of the magnetic field strength and the Doppler factor in the jet where the gamma-ray emission is produced. It is a guide to our future optical observational campaign."

The continuum of the SDSS spectrum of B3 1637+436A (May 21, 2001) and the Keck spectrum (June 28, 2003) is not significantly different, while the continuum of the BOSS spectrum (June 17, 2018) is about 1.2 magnitudes lower than the SDSS spectrum in the V band. The Halpha emission lines of the three spectra have a clear double-peaked broad line profile. Like the continuum, the double-peaked broad line profile is also considered to come from the accretion disk. By fitting the disk model of the double-peaked profile of Halpha on the three spectra, we found that the double-peaked Halpha profile of the BOSS spectrum can be well fit with a single disk model, and the emission line region lies about 900-3000 gravitational radius away from the central black hole. The double-peaked profiles of SDSS and Keck's Halpha need to be fit with two disk models. The corresponding accretion disk emission area has two regions, one of which (The outer disk) is similar to BOSS, and the other emission region (The inner disk) is located within the range of about 400-900 gravitational radius, which is much smaller than the outer disk. Combining the characteristics of variations of the continuum spectrum, we believe that the disappearance of the inner disk is the main reason for the variation between the SDSS/Keck spectrum and the BOSS spectrum."

The largest amplitudes of the near-IR variation are DeltaJ=1.0, DeltaH=0.9, DeltaK=0.86, and the color indexes are =0.82, =1.96, =1.13. The discrete correlation function (DCF) method indicates that the variability between any two infrared bands is correlated without time lag. The relation between the color index and the brightness is also investigated and the result indicates that the spectrum steeps when the source dims but the spectrum flattens when the source dims further suggesting that the emissions of 3C 273 in near-IR consist of at least two components.

We also fit the corresponding evolution curves. Our conclusions are as follows. (1) The evolution of radio quasars is from radio-loud quasars (RLQ) to radio-quiet quasars (RQQ),and at certain stage the transition is from radio quasars to Seyfert galaxies (possibly because energy from accretion cannot maintain the accretion process carsing quasar activities to decline). This supports the view that the differences between RLQ and RQQ are not due to the orientation effect but are results of evolution,and our conclusions confirm the evolution scenario from quasars to Seyfert galaxies proposed by Punsly (1996) and Park (1988).

For this purpose, we collect a number of AGNs samples, including the QSOs and Seyfert Is, for which the intensities of hydrogen Balmer lines were measured and given out in past thirty years. We complete the calculations of the Balmer decrement by use of the improved formula describing the Cerenkov line intensity, to fit the observations.

If we still in the time that matter dominated,the age of the Universe is around 8-10 Gys. On the other side,some old objects living in the Universe have been found at some redshifts,whose ages are around 11 Gys. So they are even older than the Universe. But,the Universe should not be younger than any objects,thus,the prediction value of age is not consistent with observations,this is the so-called cosmological age problem. If one wanted to make them consistent,the current value of Hubble parameter should be assumed smaller,but there is no such evidence. After people finding that the Universe is accelerating,and introducing a unknown component called dark energy,the prediction value of age becomes larger. However,recently,some older objects are still found to be older than the universe,especially when we consider the object APM 08279 + 5255 at z = 3.91 with age t = 2.1 Gys.

In this paper,we find that once the viscosity is taken into account,this age problem is alleviated and as a example we consider a special model called Ricci dark energy in this paper."

"请用英文介绍以下文本中的内容：类星体SDSS J151653.22+190048.2 (简称J1516+1900)在紫外-光学-近红外波段展现出奇特的光谱性质:其光学Halpha、Hbeta和近红外的Paalpha、Pabeta等发射线的半高全宽(full width at half maximum intensity,FWHM)均超过5000 km/s,等值宽度接近类星体平均值;而紫外波段光谱的常见发射线Lybeta、OVI、Lyalpha、NV、SiIV和CIV等,由FWHM ~1700 km/s的中等宽度成分主导.这种现象很可能是由于紫外发射线的宽线成分经尘埃消光,强度严重削弱,从而使得中等宽度成分凸显出来;在光学和近红外波段,尘埃消光减弱,发射线由宽线成分主导,潜在的中等宽度成分不容易被看到.根据中等宽度成分的线宽和J1516+1900中央超大质量黑洞的质量M_(BH)~5.75*10~8 M_⊙,在维里化假设下,估计中等宽度发射区到中央黑洞的距离约为1.6 pc.另一方面,利用J1516+1900丰富的观测谱线,结合光致电离模型计算,可以限定J1516+1900的中等宽度发射线区气体密度~10~(12) cm~(-3)、电离参数~10~(-0.65).据此估计该发射线区到中心黑洞距离~0.016 pc,只有维里化距离的1%.这一矛盾结果预示着中等宽度发射区可能具有较为复杂的物理结构,未来需要观测更多类似J1516+1900的部分遮蔽类星体并进行系统的分类和研究.","Quasar SDSS J151653.22+190048.2 (J1516+1900) presents very peculiar spectral characters in the observed ultraviolet,optical,and infrared bands:the full widths at half maximum intensity (FWHM) of optical emission lines (Halpha,Hbeta,and infrared Paalpha and Pabeta) are all larger than 5000 km/s,and the equivalent widths of these emission lines also approach to those of normal quasars;while the ultraviolet emission lines (Lybeta,OVI,Lyalpha,NV,SiIV,and CIV) are dominated by intermediate-width emission lines (IELs) with FWHM~1700 km/s.This phenomenon can be explained as a partially obscuration effect:the broad emission lines (BELs) in ultraviolet are heavily suppressed by the dust extinction and thus the IELs become prominent;the dust extinction in optical is not significant,and the IELs are hard to be detected due to the brightness of BELs.Using the IEL width and central super-massive black hole mass M_(BH)~5.75*10~8 M_⊙ of J1516+1900,and assuming that the intermediate-width emission line region (IELR) is virialized,we estimate the distance of IEL region to central black hole is about 1.6 pc.On the other side,by combining the photo-ionization calculations and observed IELs intensity,we find the IELR has a density of ~10~(12) cm~(-3),ionization parameter of ~10~(-0.65),and its distance to the central region of ~0.016 pc,which is one percent of that based on the virialized estimation.This contradiction can provide an important clue for studying the geometry,physical condition,and the origin of emission line region in active galactic nuclei."

Assembly histories of MBH may have shaped their angular momenta. In this paper we estimate radiation efficiencies of selected low-redshift SDSS QSOs (0. 025 < 0. 5). Using estimated Virial-mass values to approximate the MBH mass (M.) values,we fit predictions of the standard model of thin accretion disks to observed optical luminosities of the QSOs to individually estimate their accretion rates. The bolometric luminosity of each QSO is estimated by extrapolating its observed optical luminosities in different bandpasses using empirical panchromatic templates established through various observations. With the estimated accretion rate and bolometric luminosity we obtain the radiation efficiency of each QSO. We find a strong correlation between the radiation efficiency (epsilon) and the black-hole mass, epsilon M.~(0.63), which is similar to the result of Davis & Laor (2011). The estimated radiation efficiency of an individual MBH has a large error which includes errors propagated from various sources. We further discuss various possible biases involved in the estimates of the radiation efficiencies, as these biases potentially contribute to the result epsilon-M. relation. These include the uncertainty of approximating the MBH mass with the estimated Virial mass, the oversimplification of the accretion-disk model,the sample selection effects,and the errors of the estimated bolometric luminosities due to the limited database for templates and unknown dust/gas obscuration."

(2) Some AGNs with low accretion rate also have much shorter time lags. The time lags of the AGNs with low accretion rate are shortened because they have retrograde spins.

It presents the phenomenon of periodic outburst with two peaks. Its period is 12 years. The better model to explain the observed phenomenon is the binary black hole model in which a black hole moves around a primary black hole. The secondary black hole crashed the main accretion disk, leading to the outbursts. Based on this model, the light curves of OJ 287 are reasonably explained and the future outbursts are correctly predicted. These indirectly prove that the precession effect of general relativity and the existence of gravitational waves. The massive black hole of binary in the center of galaxy is a very important class of gravitational wave source. However, it is still very difficult to accurately determine the kinematic equations of the internal components in galaxies. Because this model provides a precise track of the secondary black hole, the gravitational waves can be studied. Based on the existing works, it is the first time for us to deduce the temporal evolutions of radiation power and waveform of gravitational waves by using the post-Newtonian approximation method.

Since the establishment of the kinematical model of SS433 was suggested in 1970, this system has drawn more and more attention. Multi-band observations have been carried out. and a lot of data has been obtained. But until now, there are still a lot of debates about the essential nature and parameters of this system. For example, the nature of the compact star, the type of the mass donor star, the acceleration and collimation of the jet are not quite certain. In this article, recent progress on the research of SS433 is described. There are three main periodic motions of SS433, the precession of the relativistic jet, the orbital motion of the binary and the nodding of the accretion disk. In section 2.1, more precise parameters of kinematical model from recent observations are given, also the thermal expanding and cooling model of the jet is introduced, which is often used to explain the X-ray emission from the jet. The mass loss process is a very important problem in the study of SS433 and other X-ray binaries. In section 2.2, different kinds of mass loss process are discussed in order to explain the mass loss of SS433. The mass loss rate of stellar wind from the mass donor star may be higher than the mass loss rate of the jet. Disk wind is a little more complicated since it may contain two components, wind vertical to the disk and wind parallel to the disk. The outflow parallel to the disk plane could be observed directly from the high resolution radio observation. From multi-band observations, one can conclude the structure of the disk in different scales, this distorted structure may be related to a lot of observational phenomena of SS433. Since the spatial resolution is limited, variability at different time scales may be the only method to study the fine structure of the central region of SS433. In section 2.3, the problem is discussed, as well as some hot spots like short time scale variability, energy flow with velocity larger than the jet velocity and two kinds of eclipses (secondary eclipse and additional eclipse). Finally, in section 2;4, the structure of the jet from the recent multi-band observations is outlined."

Our result is one order higher than the previous work made by others.As a radiation process, there is a time delay from the instance when the secondary black hole impacts on the accretion disk of the primary to the moment of the optical outburst.This time delay has to be taken into account when we try to fit the calculated orbit to the observed outburst times.Adopting a linear relation between the time delay and the impact distance as an empirical model,we fit the calculated orbit to the observed data of the recent seven outbursts of OJ287,obtain the solution of its orbital motion,and give the important orbital properties,including the averaged orbital parameters.By analyzing the result of 3.5PN order calculation of the binary system,we find some interesting features.The precession rate of secondary black hole is shown to increase to a maximum,and then to decrease at late stages,and to eventually turn into a negative value.This result might indicate the breakdown of 3.5PN approximation at late stages when a more accurate calculation is needed. More interestingly,as a main finding of this paper,we discover that the dissipative terms of 2.5th order and 3.5th order have opposite signs.This implies that the 3.5th order term itself does not radiate,but absorbs energy.However,the sum of the two terms still radiates gravitational waves outward.This is confirmed by the change rate of the energy of the system.Our results of the orbit of binary black hole OJ287 up to 3.5PN can be further used to calculate its radiated gravitational waves."

However, the EGRET had not detected its radiation. The causes of the 3C345 without gamma-ray are studied and analyzed by comparing the differences and similarities among variability amplitude, the optical shortest variability timescale and the time lag among variations in optical B band and radio band （8 GHz, 22 GHz and 37 GHz）. In variation amplitude aspect, the researching results indicate that 3C 345 is similar to 3C 279 in radio band and in optical variability amplitude, 3C 279 is the largest one, 3C345 is much less than 3C 279 and the 3C273 is the least one. All of the three objects have been detected variability on the order of days in optical band. Besides, the time lag of the 3C 345 is longer than that of 3C 279, while approximately as long as that of 3C 273. It seems that the gamma-ray spectrum of the 3C 345 was probably similar to 3C 273 and their gamma-ray luminosity was almost equal. According to the other similarities, such as both having been detected the big blue bump and the similar infrared luminosity in 3C 345 and 3C 273, we roughly amounting indicate that 3C 273 would not be detected even at the state of burst if 3C273 moved to the place of 3C345,which might be the reason why 3C 345 has not been detected by EGRET ever since."

It causes distance-independent apparent proper motions (the amplitude is about 5 as ・ yr~(-1) ) for extragalactic sources which were regarded as motionless before 21th century. As the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) has been greatly developed and the ESA (European Space Agency) space mission Gaia has provided ultra high-precision astrometric data, the Galactic aberration effect has becoming important. It will cause slow spin of the reference frame due to the non-uniform distribution of extragalactic sources. Therefore systematic corrections have to be applied to the Earth rotation parameters.

The violent activities of the high energy variability can be observed in multiple wavelength bands of quasars, and studying quasar variability can contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism of the emission from the central region. Many studies have shown that the great majority of quasar variability is considered to originate in the accretion disk's thermal emission, but some people do not agree with this view. The Hurst exponent of SDSS quasar variability is calculated using the rescaled range analysis method to investigate the fractal properties of variability in quasars from the SDSS stripe 82. The Hurst exponent results of variability show that the quasar variability is self-similar and long-range correlated. The variability obeys the biased random walk model, and its variation is similar to fractal Brownian motion. The power spectral exponent obtained from the Hurst exponent conversion shows that most of the variabilities can be approximately fitted by the damped random walk model, but a small number of samples have large deviations."

It is believed that variability is one of the denning characteristics of Blazars. Due to the complication of Blazars' light curves, the present periodicity analysis methods are not perfect. Power spectrum analysis is available if the underlying variability process is stationary, which means that the process does not change with time in statistics. Classical spectral analysis methods are unsatisfactory to solve the problem. Based on modern spectral estimation, the principle of maximum entropy estimation and Auto-regressive(AR) spectral estimation are discussed. We mainly analyze the effect of the order selection on models. Therefore, the programme applying maximum entropy estimation and AR spectral estimation to deal with the period of quasar 3C 279 and BL Lac Object OJ 287 is presented. Their derived periods of 3C 279 and OJ 287 are 7.14 and 11.76 yr, respectively. Validated by the experiments, the AR model spectrum estimation method is a good way to compute the period of light variability.

In this paper, the radio imaging results of the 298 radio sources are presented. According to their brightness distribution, we use delta function components modeling to estimate their structure delays and structure indices, which can be used to judge the astrometric suitability of a radio source.

We found 21 steep spectral radio sources with a spectral index less than -0.8, and found that their structure indices at a single band or the both bands are bigger than 3.0, which indicate those sources are not so compact and may not be suitable as defining sources of the ICRF.

Our main results are as follows: (1) Our results support the shock wave interpretation of photovariation (but require oblique shock) or magnetic reconnection interpretation. (2) There is a significant inverse correlation between EC peak luminosity lognu_(EC)~(pk)L_(EC)~(pk) and magnetic field logB. There is a positive correlation between Doppler factor logdelta and EC peak luminosity lognu_(EC)~(pk)L_(EC)~(pk), which means that the increase of Doppler factor is one of the reasons for the increase of EC peak luminosity. (3) There is no significant positive correlation between the synchronous peak frequency lognu_(syn)~(pk) and peak luminosity lognu_(syn)~(pk)L_(syn)~(pk), which means that the sequence of flares may not be valid for all flares. (4) The parameter U_e/U_B (the ratio of relativistic electron energy density to magnetic field energy density) is far from 1, indicating that the equipartition trend between relativistic electron and magnetic field is not obvious, and 86% of parameters U_e/U_B have a ratio greater than 1, which means that most of the jets in 3C 279 are dominated by particles. From the relation of P_B (magnetic field power) < P_r (radiation power)< P_e (relativistic electron power)0.5, it indicates that the energy in 3C 279 jet is also carried by cold protons. Meanwhile, we find that the gamma-ray dissipation region in 3C 279 is located at 0.1 - 1.8 PC from the black hole center, suggesting that they are located outside the broad-line region (BLR) and within the dusty Torus (DT)."

This indicates that Mrk 421 is more likely to have the phenomenon that the electron energy is one order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field energy during the light change. It also means that the jets in the Mrk 421 are dominated by particles; From the relationship of P_e>P_B,it is further shown that the Mrk 421 jets are particle-dominated,P_B?P_r,meaning that the Poynting flux cannot account for the radiated power; The ranges of P_r /P_e from 0.01 to 0.51,show that a small fraction of the relativistic electron energy may be used for the observed radiation.(5)Some ranges of the physical parameters of 3C 279 and Mrk 421 may be relatively similar,but the physical processes inside the jets of these two sources may not be the same."

QSOs are bright and have point-like morphologies, making them easy to be selected in imaging surveys. However, QSOs are the minorities in the full AGN population, as is well studied in the luminosity function of AGNs. The majority of the AGN population--the low-luminosity AGNs(hereafter LLAGNs)--remains largely inaccessible. Throughout this paper, we refer to AGNs that are at least one or two magnitudes fainter than the SDSS-III/BOSS QSOs as LLAGNs. Particularly, the surveys with LLAGNs should be 23 ～ 24 AB mag deep in g-band(-24 ?

LLAGNs are important, for example, for the purpose of constraining the faint end of the luminosity function of AGNs, studying the differences in the fueling mechanisms between weak and strong AGNs, and exploring the potential relationship between supermassive black holes and the large-scale structure in which their host galaxies reside. The sky coverages and the sample sizes of current deep surveys that contain LLAGNs at z 3 are limited(? 2 deg~2, ? 10~2).

However, the origin of variability in radio-quiet quasars remains unclear so far. In 2016, we upgraded the accretion disc model, which assumed the variability is caused by the change of global mass accretion rate, at two points. Firstly, we constrained the disc size to match the viscous timescale of accretion disc to the variability timescale observed. Secondly, we included the irradiation/X-ray reprocessing to make the emitted spectrum become steeper. In this work, we try to further validate the accretion disk-irradiation hybrid model which was produced before. We compile a sample of 465 variable radio-quiet quasars, showing a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend, with multi-epoch observations in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). It is the first time we find the composite relative difference spectra of quasars with a BWB trend is much bluer when the black hole mass is small. In addition, the spectra observed are also found to be bluer for longer time-scale observed, especially at UV band. In order to fit the observed spectra well, the values of black hole mass and the observed time-scale have to be moderately modified because of the large scatter of black hole mass estimations.

Quiescent galaxies at 1 < z < 3 have been found to be more compact than their local counterparts and show a significant structural evolution on redshift. The recent observations show the evidences suggesting that the evolution of high-z compact quiescent galaxies follows an inside-out scenario and the dry minor merger may play a major role. At z > 1, the structural evolution of normal star forming galaxies matches the expectation of hierarchical clustering model. Most of high-z starburst galaxies, including ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) and submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) , show significant merging morphological features, suggesting that major mergers are probably the main triggering mechanism of starburst activities. Morphological studies of high-z active galactic nucleus (AGNS) host galaxies reveal a mixed result. X-ray-selected AGNs with moderate luminosities do not show an enhanced merger fraction than normal galaxies. However, luminous quasars seem to have a high merger fraction. Major mergers have been suggested to be responsible only for triggering luminous AGN activities. In final, based on available observational facts so far, an evolutionary sequence of high-z galaxies, involving starburst galaxies, compact star forming galaxies, quasars and compact quiescent galaxies, has been proposed."

We also made a statistical analysis between broad-band spectral index and luminosity for XBLs and FSRQs.

In order to test these models,we collect the VLBI observations for a sample of Blazars. Totaly,the sample consists of 108 Blazars(86 FSRQs and 22 BL Lac objects).We calculate the apparent speed of all radio knots in the sample and statistically study the locations of knots with the maximum apparent speed of each Blazar in the sample.The results show that the location of the radio knots with the maximum apparent speed decreases with the decrease of the radio luminosity of Blazars,from FSRQs to LBLs to IBLs to HBLs,with the radio luminosity decreases, the distance of the radio knots with the maximum apparent speed from the core in the plane of sky gets shorter and shorter,implying that HBL jets have the shortest accelerate region.That is to say,the jet decelerating region locates near the core in Blazar with low luminosity,and the jet has decelerated from TeV-emitting region to the scale that VLBI can resolve,consistent with the deceleration model."

The results show that:(1) there is no significant difference in the M_(BH),the luminosity or the radius of the radiation area of the accretion disk between the blazars and the quasars. This paper selects the high luminosity source for research,so there is no obvious difference among parameters of the subcategory; (2) The radius ratio of the radiation area of AGN accretion disk obtained by the short time optical variability has no dependence on the M_(BH); (3) The radius ratio of radiation area of AGN accretion disk obtained by the continuous reverberation lag method is more dependent on the black hole than that obtained by standard a disk model method. For the source that cannot determine the M_(BH),the radius of radiation area of AGN accretion disk can be obtained by the continuous reverberation lag method; (4) There is no obvious correlation between the radius of radiation area of AGN accretion disk by the gravitational microlensing method and the M_(BH),and the method is only applicable to quasars with micro-gravitational lens effects; (5) These methods prove that the radius of the radiation area of AGN accretion disk is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, which verifies that the standard model is established. It provides theoretical guidance for further exploration of the sources needed for these four methods, which is of significant value for the study on the radius of the radiation area of AGN accretion disk."

Both spectral energy distributions(SEDs) of synchrotron and inverse Compton(IC) components are fitted by a log-parabolic law in lg nu - lg nuf_v diagram. The second-degree term of log-parabolic measures the curvature of SED. Our main intent is to explore the curvature properties of spectral energy distribution of Fermi blazars. Our main results are as follows: a significant correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and its curvature for flat spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects(BL Lacs) is found, but the correlation formulas are different for FSRQs and BL Lacs. Comparing our observational results and the theoretical predictions of different models, we find that the observational results of FSRQs are consistent with the fluctuation of fractional acceleration gain model, while the observational results of BL Lacs are consistent with the energy-dependent acceleration probability model. The mean value of synchrotron curvature of FSRQs is larger than that of BL Lacs, which suggests the particle acceleration efficiency of BL Lacs is higher than that of FSRQs. It should be attributed to the jet plasma of FSRQs dissipated within the broad-line region(BLR) and suffered stronger cooling. We also find that FSRQs and Low-energy peaked BL Lacs(LBLs) have similar SED properties, which is consistent with previous results. We do not find a significant correlation between the IC peak frequency and its curvature for FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be caused by complicated seed photon field and radiation processes."

The Lorentz factor and variability indexes of BL Lacertae objects are smaller than those of flat spectrum radio quasars。It is also found that 89% of the sources have a small viewing angle of less than 21 degrees.

This prediction has been verified by the laboratory experiments in the optical waveband. In this paper, we present the basic formula for calculating the intensity ratio and the intrinsic redshift ratio of the Cerenkov iron Ka and Kbetalines. Using these formulae, we calculate the intensity ratios and the redshift ratios of the Cerenkov iron Ka and Kbetalines for different valences of iron ions, which can be examined by the observations of AGNs. The recent observations show that, except for the iron Kalphaline at～6. 4 keV, there is also an apparent iron Kbetaline at～7. 0 keV in NGC 3783 with intensity markedly higher than the predicted one by the traditional fluorescence emission. We argue that, the Cerenkov line-like radiation can provide a way to solve the puzzle of the observed anomalous ratio of the equivalent widths EW_(Kalpha)/EW_(Kbeta)3.43, which is difficult to understand from the conventionalphotoelectric absorption-fluorescence emissionmechanism. Besides, we expected that the intrinsic redshift ratio of the Cerenkov iron Kalphaand Kbetalines could be verified in future observations.

Our results show that the history of black hole accretion can not be well reproduced with the constant Eddington ratio, and the Eddington ratio needs to increase with the redshift in a specific range.

These broad-lined active galactic nuclei (AGNs) possess the spectral signatures of massive intermediate-aged stellar populations, making them potentially useful for studying the connections between nuclear activity and host galaxy evolution. With the help of the stellar synthesis code starlight, we determine the ages of the host stellar populations, the black hole masses, and Eddington fractions of the AGNs. We find that the PSQs have MBH ~ 10~8 M_⊙ accreting at a few percent of Eddington luminosity, and the ages of host stellar populations are several hundred Myr to a few Gyr old. The result may support a delay between the merger-induced starburst and the quasar being triggered/becoming visible. And the estimated total IR luminosity is greater than 10~(11) L_⊙, which may reveal the connection between the Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and the PSQs. We still find no significant correlations between AGN and starburst properties. It's very strange, especially if the triggering mechanism of starburst also triggered the AGN activity, bringing a kind of correlations between them. Maybe the selection effects limit our ability to see the correlations or there could be multiple types of triggering events.

Ten HI absorption candidates have been detected. Five of them are previously published in the literature, and the rest of them are new detections that need further confirmation. For those sources with no detected absorptions, we calculated the upper limits of their foreground HI column density N_(HI)・ The statistical result of the N_(HI) distribution indicates that the ratio of average spin temperature to covering factor T_s/f for DLAs (the damped Lyalpha systems) might be larger than 500 K. Radio frequency interference (RFI) and standing waves are the main issues affecting the detection of HI absorption profiles. Our study can serve as the pathfinder for a large scale search of HI 21-cm absorption lines using the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) which is an Arecibo-type radio telescope currently under construction in China. We discuss two types of observational studies of HI absorptions toward extragalactic sources using the FAST telescope."

Through the observational period, the GeV gamma-ray-loud source, PKS 1510-089, was very active and, it showed a significant variability of 2.0 mag within 41 min in the R band. This is the most violently rapid variability in our optical monitoring program for blazars since 1982. For this source, some physical parameters, namely the emission size, Doppler factor delta, the efficiency (eta) for conversion of accreted matter into energy and luminosity re calculated. Aeta = 59.6 was obtained, strongly implying that the relativistic beaming is responsible for the rapid variability of the gamma-ray loud source. The influence of variable seeing conditions on the observations was carefully investigated. There is weak correlation between the observed variability and the local seeing conditions for the object 1ES 2344 + 514. The results show that the seeing fluctuations would influence the spurious variation in microvariability when the variability parameter C < 5."

Thereafter, we discuss their physical implications, the theoretic interpretations and the indications on the inner structures of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Narrow-line Serfert Galaxies (NSL1s) are identified as the Narrow Hbetapermitted emission lines in their optical spectra,in which the properties of Seyfert I and II galaxies are presented partically. NLS1s with the strongest optical FeII line blends and weak [O III] forbidden lines, obviously differe from Seyfert II galaxies. Classified as the subclass of normal Seyfert I galaxies, NSL1s have the extreme properties of the observational parameters in Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Therefore, they are the primary objects to understand the characteristics and structures of board emission line region and the innermost machines surrounding the central black hole. By means of PCA, NLSI_s locate in the extreme end of the Board-line AGNs, such as (1) the narrowest H_beta line, (2) the largest ratio of Fe II lambda4507/H_beta, (3) the largest ratio of Si III] lambda1892/C III]lambda1909 indicating electron density of board line clouds in a certain range, (4) the largest C IVlambda1549 emission line blueshfit, (5) the steepest soft X-ray photon spectrum index, (6) the giant amplitude of the soft X-ray excess variance. Following the above observational properties and statistical analysis results (H_beta FWHM vs. other observation quantities), we comment that the L/L_(Edd) model is the best interpretation. As the prediction of this model, NLS1s have a reasonably esimate of the low black hole masses. On the other hand, the non-spherical structure of AGNs possibly rises the anisotropic velocitis dispersion. The orientation effect can not be neglected when we try to build the kinetic model ofNSL1s. The high accretion rate model with the orientation effect should let us to understand the dominant emission mechanism of AGNs and its influence on the observational properties."

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside at the centers of galaxies and emit excessive electromagnetic radiation, whose ultimate energy source is the release of the gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter in the form of thermal and radiation energy. Multi-timescale and multi-band variability is a characteristic observational feature of AGNs. In particular, X-ray variability is most worth noting because of being intense and rapid, as well as carrying rich physical information of the innermost region of the accretion disk. Therefore, AGN X-ray variability has long been used as a probe for studying SMBHs. However, at present, we still lack a very fundamental understanding of AGN X-ray variability, whose origin and mechanisms remain largely unclear. The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite has an unprecedented soft X-ray survey capability, with a grasp (i.e., the product of detector effective area and field of view) being one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous similar satellites. EP is able to monitor hundreds of bright AGNs in the whole sky with sampling intervals ranging from 100 s to years, and will thereby build an exceptional AGN variability database. Accordingly, we propose to carry out AGN investigations mainly in the following four aspects: comprehensive measurement of the soft X-ray power spectral density for a large sample of bright AGNs; systematic monitoring and study of the rare large-amplitude AGN X-ray variability and flaring phenomenon; examination of long-term spectral variability for a large sample of AGNs and monitoring of their outbursts; and AGN/ quasar survey. These unprecedented data will facilitate our further understanding of many scientific questions, such as the intense AGN X-ray variability and flaring phenomenon and its mechanisms, the physical conditions, structures, dynamics, and radiation processes of the AGN accretion disk, jet, and corona, as well as the AGN cosmological evolution. Furthermore, given EPs capability of exploring a brand-new discovery space (large sky-area, long-timescale, and systematic soft X-ray monitoring), we are likely to discover some black hole accretion phenomena never seen before the complexity and diversity of the Universe are always beyond human imagination.","活动星系核(AGN)是指那些具有强烈电磁辐射的星系核心,其巨大能量是由中心超大质量黑洞(SMBH)吸积周围物质,将其释放的引力能转化为热能、辐射能而产生的.各种时标的多波段光变是AGN的典型观测特征,其中尤以X射线光变最为引人注意,因为其光变剧烈、时标短、携带着AGN吸积盘最内区的丰富物理信息,长期以来一直被用作研究星系中心SMBH的探针.但是,目前对AGN的X射线光变还没有很根本的认识,对其来源和产生机制仍不甚清楚.爱因斯坦探针(Einstein Probe, EP)卫星具有空前的软X射线巡天能力,其grasp(即探测器有效面积与视场的乘积)比起之前同类卫星提高了一到两个量级,这使得EP能在从百秒到年的采样频率上对全天数百个亮AGN进行监测,获得前所未有的大样本、宽采样频率覆盖的光变数据.我们拟据此重点开展以下4个方面的研究:对大样本亮AGN的软X射线功率谱进行完整测量;系统监测和研究AGN中罕见的大幅度X射线光变和耀发现象;研究大样本AGN的长期光谱变化以及开展其爆发监测;开展AGN/类星体巡天.这些数据将促进对AGN X射线辐射的剧烈光变与爆发现象及其产生机制, SMBH的吸积盘、喷流及冕区的物理条件、结构、动力学与辐射过程,以及AGN的宇宙学演化等科学问题的进一步认识.另外,鉴于EP能够探索一个全新的发现空间(大天区、长时标软X射线的系统监测),将有可能发现前所未见的黑洞吸积现象宇宙的复杂多样性总是超乎人类的想象."

They have significant values in studying the origin of the supermassive BHs in high-redshift quasars (namely the seed BHs problem) and the astronomical sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. The number of broad-line IMBH AGN in the local universe, owing to the great development of large-scale optical spectroscopic surveys, has been more than 500. For those optically selected IMBH AGN, the radio studies based on the VLA FIRST survey data and follow-up radio continuum observations of individuals and small samples, have obtained meaningful results already. This article reviews the progresses in the field of radio continua of IMBH AGN, detailed in the following 4 aspects: the radio morphology, continuum slope, radio power and loudness, and fundamental plane of BH activity. Moreover, preparing for the ongoing large-scale continuum surveys as SKA pathfinder projects (eg, VLASS and EMU) and for the SKA era 10 years later (SKA1 at least), we prospect the achievable goals for IMBH AGNs in the pathfinder and SKA eras respectively.

There are two modes of the AGN feedback in the semi analysis model: radio mode and quasar mode. The former mainly takes place in the massive dark matter halos, and the later mainly takes place in the low-mass dark matter halos. We use the largest quasar sample and group catalogs which are all extracted from the SDSS observation to study the relation between the quasars and dark matter halos. The preliminary results show that the bolometric luminosity of quasars is independent of the halo mass which is consistent with the previous results and quasars reside in a broad range of host halos, We further prove that the most luminous quasar do not live in the most massive halo.","活动星系核的能量反馈是星系形成理论模型中的一个重要物理过程,与星系所处的暗物质晕质量、星系中央大质量黑洞吸积率等因素有关。当前的半解析模型预测活动星系核反馈机制主要有两种模式:射电模式和类星体模式,前者主要发生在大质量暗晕中央的大质量星系中,后者主要由较小质量星系并合导致。利用斯隆数字化巡天(SDSS)提供的目前最大的类星体光谱观测样本,结合基于SDSS构建的星系群(团)表,从统计上分析了类星体的热光度和暗晕质量的分布情况。初步分析结果显示,在大质量暗晕中,类星体的热光度和所在暗晕的质量没有相关性,类星体所在暗晕的质量分布很广,进一步证实了高光度的类星体并不存在于大质量的暗晕中。"

The redshift of quasar is 1.7340.002. We recognize two C IV and two Mg II narrow absorption systems in the spectra of two images. The C IV absorption systems are alike in the spectra of the two images, but the two Mg II absorption systems are very different. The Mg II absorption system with redshift of 0.831 10.000 3 only exist in spectrum of A image, while another Mg II absorption system with redshift of 0.671 10.006 1 only exist in B image. If they exist in the both images, their physical separations in the transverse direction (Dtra) are 21.319 and 26.280 kpc, respectively. We thought that the differences of Mg II absorption systems are probably from the different absorbers in the two images of SDSS J1004+4112, and the sizes of these absorbers may be smaller than Dtra. The velocity of Mg II absorber with redshift of 0.671 10.006 1 relative to lens is | betal |<0.02, therefore the absorber maybe root in the intrinsic absorber of lens galaxy.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Damped Lyman a Absorption systems (DLAs) are high column density gaseous systems (lg(NH I) >20.2), detected through their absorption lines in the optical spectra of quasars at up to relatively high redshifts(-5). They are regarded as the reservoirs of neutral gas in the Universe. Their study constitutes a powerful means to investigate the properties of distant galaxies and intergalactic medium (IGM). In this first one of the two review papers, we give a detailed introduction to the recent progress in DLAs surveys. The next will review the results and progress in cosmic abundances of chemical elements and galactic evolution based on DLAs surveys and researches. The first systematic search for DLAs was done by Wolfe et al. in 1986. This Lick survey has found 15 systems at a mean redshift of 2.5 along the line of sight of 68 QSOs. Later, a series of surveys found more DLAs absorbers, but most of them are biased towards high redshifts since surveys at low and intermediate redshifts are difficult due to the lack of UV observations. In the recent years, the number of DLAs has increased substantially, especially from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). After mining the thousands of QSOs spectra from SDSS, Prochaska et al. and Noterdaeme et al. have found 738 and 937 DLAs respectively, increasing by one order of magnitude the number of known DLAs. The large sample of DLAs has statistically derived and/or confirmed some important results about the properties of neutral gas evolution across the cosmic time. One of the important quantities of DLAs from these surveys is the frequency distribution function f (N, H I). Early surveys show that this function can be described by a power law. But recent large sample surveys show that the slope of f (N, H I) is much larger at high column density (lg(NH I) >21.5). The whole shape can be well fitted by a double power law or Gammafunction. The large slope at high column density implies that the systems at large neutral column density are rare. On the other hand, the shapes of f (N, H I) for different redshits are similar. This invariant suggests that the DLAs might not consume the gas according to th e classical Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law and that the accretion of gas into existing H I galaxies must be balanced by the consumption of gas into stars and its removal from galaxies. DLAs contain most of the neutral gas in the Universe at 0 < z <5.0. The results from surveys show that the cosmological mass density of neutral gas is indeed dominated by DLAs for redshfits between 2.2 and 5.0. But there still exist some controversies for the cosmic evolution of ?DLA, the mass density of neutral gas in DLAs, especially at low redshifts between o and 2. The measured t2gDLA at z 3 is about 10-3.","阻尼莱曼alpha吸收线系统(DLAs)是中性氢柱密度超过2xl0~20 cm~-2的类星体吸收线系统. 按照现有的观点, DLAs是高红移环境中星系及恒星形成的中性气体库, 它们很可能是现今星系的前身. 近20年来随着DLAs巡天观测的迅猛发展, 尤其是SDSS巡天观测数据的释放, DLAs统计样本达到千计的量级, 大大推动了DLAs的观测和研究. 由于受到观测的某些限制, 样 本还有偏, 尤其是缺少低红移DLAs, 但是, 通过大样本DLAs系统的研究, 已经获得了有关宇宙 中性气体演化的许多信息, 如DLAs的数密度在高红移处(z>1.5)是有演化的, 但在低红移处基 本不演化, 从而确认了今天的星系形成于较高红移处. 研究也发现DLAs对宇宙质量密度的贡献 随红移的演化减弱, DLAs的中性氢气体柱密度分布函数与本地星系的中性氢柱密度分布函数十 分相似等一些有趣的结论. 着重介绍DLAs的基本知识以及20年来巡天的有关进展, 包括DLAs 的观测证认、统计特性等, 并指出目前DLAs样本不完备的主要原因"
"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Dark energy and dark matter,two subjects of basic physics,have received a lot of attention in the 21st century.From the observational point of view,the interaction between dark energy and dark matter can significantly affect cosmological distances.This gives rise to the possibility of indirectly detecting such interaction through high-redshift cosmological probes.Theoretically,the introduction of interaction between dark energy and dark matter can assist in alleviating the coincidence problem of the standard cosmological model (LambdaCDM model).Furthermore,this can provide a new method of studying the properties of dark matter particles.In this paper,based on the latest observations of multiple measurements of quasars (Xray+ UV quasars acting as standard candles,compact radio quasars acting as standard rulers) covering the redshift range of 0.04 <5.1 and baryonic acoustic oscillation between (0.38 <2.34),we investigate the observational constraints on a variety of interacting dark energy models (gamma_dIDE model,gamma_mIDE model) and other cosmological models (LambdaCDM model,XCDM model).The results provide us with a quantitative analysis of the possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter,as well as the possible range of the mass of dark matter particles.The joint analysis shows that:(1) Multiple measurements of quasars can provide more stringent constraints on the interacting dark energy models,which can further strengthen the potential of quasars acting as effective cosmological standard probes at higher redshifts;(2) In the framework of both gamma_mIDE model and gamma_dIDE model,the quasar data supports possible conversion of dark energy into dark matter at high redshift,which alleviates the coincidence problem to some extent.We also found that the interaction term is of a small value,which demonstrates the negligible interaction between dark matter and dark energy;(3) In the framework of LambdaCDM model,which has shown the best consistency with quasar data,the density parameter of matter in the Universe is constrained at Omega_m = 0.317_(-0.007)~(+0.007),with the best-fit Hubble constant H0 = 68.177+0.497-0.505 at 68.3% confidence level.These findings are consistent with the recent microwave background radiation (CMB) measurements from the Planck satellite;(4) If dark matter in the Universe exists in the form of scalar-field dark matter with Z2 symmetry,we obtain the range of the mass of dark matter particles as 56 GeV ? mS ? 63 GeV or mS ? 450 GeV,based on the dark energy-dark matter coupling term from multiple measurements of quasars.Such conclusions agree well with the latest experimental results aimed at the direct detection of dark matter particles.","暗能量和暗物质是21世纪基础物理学研究中的两个重大科学问题.在观测上,暗能量与暗物质存在的相互作用可以在大尺度上影响宇宙学距离,这为通过高红移宇宙学探针间接探测该相互作用提供了可能性.在理论上,引入暗能量与暗物质的相互作用有助于缓解标准宇宙学模型(LambdaCDM模型)的巧合性问题,并为研究暗物质粒子的性质带来新的方法.本文使用类星体在多波段的最新观测数据(X射线和紫外波段类星体作为宇宙标准烛光、致密射电类星体作为宇宙标准直尺)(0.04 <5.1),结合最新的重子声学振荡观测结果(0.38 <2.34)对多种相互作用暗能量模型(gamma_dIDE模型、gamma_mIDE模型)和其他宇宙学模型(LambdaCDM模型、XCDM模型)进行了高精度观测检验,并对暗能量与暗物质间可能的相互作用、暗物质粒子的质量区间进行了定量分析.结果显示,(1)多波段类星体数据可以将相互作用暗能量模型参数限制得更加紧密,从而进一步证实了类星体作为标准探针应用到宇宙学研究中的巨大潜力.(2)在gamma_mIDE模型和gamma_dIDE模型的框架下,多波段类星体数据都支持高红移处暗能量转化为暗物质的可能性,从而在一定程度上缓解了巧合性问题.同时,我们发现表征暗物质与暗能量相互作用强度的值非常小,这表明暗能量与暗物质间的相互作用强度非常弱.(3)LambdaCDM模型是与多波段类星体数据符合得最好的宇宙学模型.在该模型的框架下,宇宙中物质的密度参数为Omega_m = 0.317_(-0.007)~(+0.007),哈勃常数为H0 = 68.177+0.497-0.505(68.3%的置信区间).该结果与普朗克卫星对微波背景辐射(CMB)的最新测量符合得很好.(4)假设宇宙中的暗物质以拥有Z2对称性的实标量暗物质的形式存在,结合多波段类星体对暗能量-暗物质耦合系数的限制,可以将暗物质粒子的质量区间确定为56 GeV ? mS ? 63 GeV或mS ? 450 GeV.该结果与直接探测暗物质实验给出的最新测量保持一致."
"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) is a powerful tool to analyze correlation between two sets. A kind of the progressive DCF technique, time-transformed DCF (TDCF), is used to analyze time lag between variations of gamma-ray and J or B bands for 3C 454.3. The TDCFs of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray vs SMARTS J and B bands light curves both peak at gamma=-1.66 days. This implies that y-ray variations lead the J band ones by about 2 days. The period of the data is from JD-2 454 710 to JD=2 454 770. Considering the effects of flux errors and sampling characteristics,FR,RSS and the combined of them are used to Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the time lags and the uncertainties. The simulations show that the y-rays lead the J band emission. Thus it is reliable that the gamma-rays lead the J band emission. The time lag might be due to the cooling time-scale of electrons' synchrotron and Compton radiations. In this case, the energy of 'seed' photons couldn't be higher than l.1 eV. The time lag also might be related to the different sizes of their emission regions. The strong correlation of the two variations indicates that the gamma-rays and the J band emission are emitted from 'the same region. As a shock spreads in the region,it first influences the whole gamma-ray emission region. At this time, the y-ray flux reaches its maximum value. The inner gamma-ray emission region is only a part of the NIR emission region. Thus the NIR flux has not reached its maximum value as the gamma-rays reach the maximum. As the shock spreads the whole NIR emission region,a few days later, the NIR fiux reaches its maximum. Time-scale of variations indicates the size of an emission region. The structure functions show that the timescale of the J band variations is larger than that of the gamma-rays, about 2 days. This timescale difference of about 2 days is consistent with the time lag of the J band emission relative to the gamma-rays. This agreement supports the above explanation of the time lag. Around JD≌2 454 712, both the gamma-rays and the optical B band emission show their minimum flux, which also supports the above explanation","2008年秋天,3C 454.3在gamma射线能段和光学波段呈现出非常大的爆发,在这次爆发过程中Fermi/LAT和SMARTS都对其进行了观测.通过对,gamma射线能段与SMARTS J及B波段在这次大爆发期间获得的光变数据进行细致的DCF分析发现:这段时期内3C 454.3的J波段光变落后,gamma射线光变大约2d.在进行相关性分析过程中,对DCF做了稍许改进,得到一种改进的 DCF-时间变换的离散相关函数(TDCF).TDCF的峰值在gamma=-1.66 d,无论是对TDCF取重心还是用非对称的高斯函数拟合,其结果都显示3C 454.3的J波段光变落后gamma射线光变大约2 d.FR/RSS Monte Carlo模拟结果也显示gamma射线领先近红外(光学)光变.如果这个延时是由于电子辐射冷却产生的,那么逆康普顿散射的种子光子能量不能大于1.1 eV.这个延时也可能是由于辐射区域的大小不同引起的,2d的延时反映了两个波段辐射区域的几何性质.高能与低能波段光变有较强的相关性证明这两个波段的辐射是由同一辐射区域产生的:gamma射线辐射来自于辐射区域的内部,近红外辐射来自于包括gamma射线辐射区域在内的更大区域.由于近红外的辐射区域大于gamma射线辐射区域,引起光变的相对论激波传播到整个近红外辐射区域比传播到整个gamma射线辐射区域所用的时间长;因此,观测到了J,波段光变落后7射线光变的现象.通过结构函数分析得到的两个波段的光变时标相差约2.5 d,这与大约2d的延时符合得很好"

An overview of our current understanding of the interstellar extinction laws of the MilkyWay (MW) and external galaxies is presented. In the MW, the extinction law in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical can be characterized by a one-parameter function of RV = AV=E(B - V); the near-infrared (IR) extinction law appears to be an approximately uniform power law of A_lambda ~(lambda-alpha); an universal flat extinction law is found in the mid-IR (3 ~ 8 mum). In the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the extinction curve rises steeply in the UV and lacks the 2 175 A bump in the bar region. However, in the SMC wing region, the extinction curve rises less steeply in the UV and the 2 175 A bump is present. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the average extinction is intermediate between that of the MW and SMC. The 2 175 A bump in the star-forming regions of LMC 30 Dor and supershell LMC 2 is much weaker than that of the MW. For M31, the extinction curve resembles that of the MW.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Even though Blazars have been well studied at multiple wavelengths and much insight has been gained into the nature of these extreme objects, there are still numerous open issues remaining, such as the composition and formation of relativistic jets, the radiative mechanism of the high-energy part of the SED, the location of gamma-ray emission region, etc. Variability studies, including the studies of variability time scale, light curve variation, spectral changes and multiwavelength correlation, could reveal the location of the emission region, the changes in the condition and structure in the emission region and the changes in the radiative processes and mechanisms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the gamma-ray variability. VLBI is the unique method to resolve Blazars on pc scale, thus the combination of gamma-ray and radio studies would promote the localization of the gamma-ray emission region and other research on jet properties. In particular, the connections between gamma-ray flares and ejections of radio components have been found in a number of Blazars, for example, OJ 287, PKS 1510-089, Mrk 421, 3C 454.3, etc. However, there are also contradictions in previous studies, such as whethergamma-ray or radio leads, so further analyses and research are required.In this paper, the Fermi-LAT data from 5 August 2008 to 23 October 2013 has been used to investigate the gamma-ray properties of 4C 21.35 between 100 MeV and 300 GeV.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：In a standard model of active galactic nuclei(AGNs),there is a supermassive central black hole surrounded by an accretion disk with the jet coming out perpendicularly to the disk plane. Theoretical works suggest that there is a connection between the jet and the accretion disk. To investigate such a connection, people use the correlation between the radio emission(or gamma-ray emission) and the broad line emission. However, it is well known that the radio(or gamma-ray) emission is strongly beamed in blazars. In this sense, we should consider the beaming effect when we discuss the jet-accretion disk connection. In this work, we compiled a sample of 202 Fermi/LAT blazars with available broad line emissions. Out of the 202 sources,66 have known Doppler factors. The correlation between gamma-ray and broad-line emission, and that between radio and broad-line emission are investigated by removing the effects of redshift and beaming boosting for the whole sample and the subclasses,flat spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects(BL Lacs) respectively. Our analysis suggests that(1) There are strong correlations between the gamma-ray and the broad line emission for the whole blazar sample and their subclasses.

Based on the collected cases, we discuss their overall characteristics, among which the detected periods have a strong observational selection effect and there are few cases with high significance so far. We briefy discuss the mechanisms for producing quasi-periodic oscillations currently under consideration, most of which are related to the Lenense-Thirring effect or binary nature of the central black hole systems.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：In the present thesis, the basic properties and research results about the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are reviewed. It is focused on the multiband observation and the properties of multiband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars that would constraint the emission models of blazars. Our main work and results are as follows. (1) studying on the short timescale variability of gamma- ray blazars. Our CCD monitoring campaign form 1998 has monitored 16 gamma- ray blazars, including all the TeV sources and some suspicious TeV objects. The observational results show that the short timescale (about 1 hour) variability is the common property for the GeV gamma- ray blazars, and the amplitude variation in each optical band (B, V, R, I) could reach to 0.6 mag/hour. The Gev gamma- ray - loud source, PKS 1510-089, was very active during our observation period, and it shoed an apparent variation of 2.0 mag within 41 minutes in the R band. This is the most violently rapid variability in the optical monitoring program since 1982. For this rapid dimming variability phenomenon, there is not any suitable theoretical explanation so far, however, this is the reflection of emission region structure. As for the TeV gamma- ray blazars, the short timescale variability in the optical band is less drastic than GeV gamma- ray blazars in both the amplitude and timescale; (2) The influence of variable seeing conditions on the observations was investigated. There is weak correlation between the observed variability and the local seeing conditions for the objects 1ES 2344 + 514. This implies that the source brightness decreased, while the FWHM of PSF increased, removing more light from the aperture, i. e. there would be some spurious variation influenced by variable seeing conditions. (3) The two composite color - color indices alpha_(xox) = alpha_(ox) - alpha_x and alpha_(oro) = alpha_(or) - alpha_o are introduced. The statistical results for the selected samples show that the RBLs are intermediate between the XBLs and the OVV quasars as suggested by Sumbruna et al. (1996). (4)The overview of the VHE gamma- ray observations by using the ground based Cerenkov imaging telescope and other detectors is presented. Because of their variability at all wavelengths, blazars can be well understood through the multi - wavelength observations. The sensitivity of the VHE telescopes to the sub - hour scale variability, and their ability to detect how source fluxes, as well as the spectral measurement up to 10 TeV or more make the VHE observations an important addition to the multi - wavelength campaigns. In particular, if the gamma- ray emission arises from inverse Compton scattering of the same electron population which produces the low energy synchrotron emission, the combination of VHE gamma- ray and synchrotron observations permit the estimation of the magnetic field strength and the Doppler factor in the jet where the gamma-ray emission is produced. It is a guide to our future optical observational campaign.",本文综述了活动星系核，特别是blazar天体的研究现状，对blazar天体的多波段与多波段能谱特性研究进行了较为详细的评述。主要的研究工作包括以下内容：（一）gamma噪blazar天体的短时标光变研究，通过对16个gamma噪blazar天体（其中包括全部已证认和观测到VHEgamma射线爆发的可能甚高能gamma射线源）自1998年的光学观测及光变分析研究表明，短时标光变（小时量级）是GeV gamma噪blazar天体的普遍特性，光变幅度通常可达0.6mag/h，对PKS 1510－089类星体的观测发现在一个小时内对象变暗2个星等，对如此激烈的光变变暗目前的理论还不能很好的解释，但它同样反映了辐射区域的内部结构；而对TBLs的监测表明，其光学波段的短时标光变没有其他对象激烈，出现的频度和振幅变化都较小；（二）在研究gamma噪blazar天体光变时，研究了寄主星系对光变的影响，得到了1ES 2344+514的光变与PSF的FWHM的关联，表明随着大气视宁度的下降（即FWHM变大），对象变暗，即由于寄主星系的影响从而导致假光变的产生；（三）引进两个多波段复合谱指数，alphaXOX=alphaOX-alphaX及alphaoro=alphaor-alphao。对样本的统计研究表明，RBLs是能谱特性界于XBLs和OVVs之间的一类中间态，所得结果支持了Sambruna et al.（1996）大样本多波段能谱分布特性的统计研究结果；（四）对地面探测器对blazar天体甚高能波段的观测做了较为详细的了解，由于blazar天体在全波段上都观测到光变，所以这类对象是多波段观测研究最完全的。地面望远镜对小时量级的光变很敏感，所以，对低流量源的直到10TeV或更高能谱的测量是多波段研究的重要扩展，特别是，如果gamma射线的幅射是通过康谱顿散射提升低能同步辐射光子产生的，即SSC模型产生，那么，VHEgamma射线的观测和低能同步辐射的观测就可能估计喷流内的磁场强度、Doppler因子等。对我们今后的光学波段的观测工作提出了新的课题。

The continuum of the SDSS spectrum of B3 1637+436A (May 21, 2001) and the Keck spectrum (June 28, 2003) is not significantly different, while the continuum of the BOSS spectrum (June 17, 2018) is about 1.2 magnitudes lower than the SDSS spectrum in the V band. The Halpha emission lines of the three spectra have a clear double-peaked broad line profile. Like the continuum, the double-peaked broad line profile is also considered to come from the accretion disk. By fitting the disk model of the double-peaked profile of Halpha on the three spectra, we found that the double-peaked Halpha profile of the BOSS spectrum can be well fit with a single disk model, and the emission line region lies about 900-3000 gravitational radius away from the central black hole. The double-peaked profiles of SDSS and Keck's Halpha need to be fit with two disk models. The corresponding accretion disk emission area has two regions, one of which (The outer disk) is similar to BOSS, and the other emission region (The inner disk) is located within the range of about 400-900 gravitational radius, which is much smaller than the outer disk. Combining the characteristics of variations of the continuum spectrum, we believe that the disappearance of the inner disk is the main reason for the variation between the SDSS/Keck spectrum and the BOSS spectrum.","通过对比间隔17 yr(静止系12.5 yr)的Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS)、Keck LRIS(Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph)和Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey(BOSS)的光学光谱,对宽线双峰射电类星体B3 1637+436A的吸积盘性质做了初步研究.该类星体的SDSS(2001年5月21日)和Keck LRIS(2003年6月28日)的连续谱没有明显差异,而BOSS(2018月6月17日)连续谱在V波段比SDSS暗了约1.2星等.这3条光谱的Halpha宽发射线均表现出明显的双峰轮廓.和连续谱一样,宽线双峰的发射线轮廓也被认为是来自于吸积盘.通过上述3条光谱的Halpha宽线双峰的盘模型拟合发现: BOSS光谱的Halpha宽线双峰可以用单个盘模型很好地拟合,谱线发射区距离中心黑洞约900-3000引力半径.而SDSS和Keck LRIS的Halpha双峰轮廓需要用两个盘模型拟合,对应的吸积盘发射区有两个区域,其中一个发射区(外盘)与BOSS类似,另一个发射区(内盘)位于约400-900引力半径范围内,到中心黑洞的距离显著小于外盘.结合连续谱的光变特征,推测内盘消失是造成SDSS/Keck LRIS光谱和BOSS光谱在连续谱和发射线轮廓上同时发生光变的主要原因."

Based on the Logistic Regression,we analyze the relations of black-hole mass estimates,radio luminosities in 5GHz, Eddington rates,and core-dominated parameter (R) values versus redshifts. We also fit the corresponding evolution curves. Our conclusions are as follows. (1) The evolution of radio quasars is from radio-loud quasars (RLQ) to radio-quiet quasars (RQQ),and at certain stage the transition is from radio quasars to Seyfert galaxies (possibly because energy from accretion cannot maintain the accretion process carsing quasar activities to decline). This supports the view that the differences between RLQ and RQQ are not due to the orientation effect but are results of evolution,and our conclusions confirm the evolution scenario from quasars to Seyfert galaxies proposed by Punsly (1996) and Park (1988). It can explain why RLQs,which tend to have high redshifts,high luminosities,and high accretion rates,likely appear in the early stage of the universe,but all these properties show decrease trends with redshifts and quasar activities began to decline.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Our Universe has been dominated by inflaton field,radiation and matter during its evolution. If we still in the time that matter dominated,the age of the Universe is around 8-10 Gys. On the other side,some old objects living in the Universe have been found at some redshifts,whose ages are around 11 Gys. So they are even older than the Universe. But,the Universe should not be younger than any objects,thus,the prediction value of age is not consistent with observations,this is the so-called cosmological age problem. If one wanted to make them consistent,the current value of Hubble parameter should be assumed smaller,but there is no such evidence. After people finding that the Universe is accelerating,and introducing a unknown component called dark energy,the prediction value of age becomes larger. However,recently,some older objects are still found to be older than the universe,especially when we consider the object APM 08279 + 5255 at z = 3.91 with age t = 2.1 Gys. So,we should study it further by considering viscous fluid in the Universe,since perfect fluid may be a strict assumption. In this paper,we find that once the viscosity is taken into account,this age problem is alleviated and as a example we consider a special model called Ricci dark energy in this paper.","在宇宙的演化过程当中,经历了暴胀、辐射以及物质为主时期。如果宇宙现在仍处于物质为主时期,那么理论上所得到的宇宙年龄大概是在80~100亿年左右。另一方面,人们测得一些古老星团的年龄超过了110亿年,由此可见,理论预言与观测结果不相符合,这就是宇宙的年龄问题。当前的观测表明宇宙正处于加速膨胀时期,人们通常将加速的原因归结于宇宙中存在着一种被称为暗能量的物质组分。人们进一步发现由于这种组分可以使理论上预言的宇宙年龄变大,从而缓解了宇宙年龄问题。可是,最新的观测表明,仍有一些天体的年龄比预言的宇宙年龄要大,比如说类星体APM08279+5255,它在红移等于3.91时的年龄大概是21亿年,超过了当时的宇宙年龄.事实上,通常人们在研究宇宙学中,仅仅考虑了理想流体这一简单模型,而该模型可能过于简单.因此,本文将考虑带有黏滞性的流体.通过引入黏滞性,宇宙的年龄问题被进一步缓解了.尽管,本文考虑一类被称为Ricci暗能量的模型,但是所得到的结论可以推广和应用到各种暗能量模型中."

Assembly histories of MBH may have shaped their angular momenta. In this paper we estimate radiation efficiencies of selected low-redshift SDSS QSOs (0. 025 < 0. 5). Using estimated Virial-mass values to approximate the MBH mass (M.) values,we fit predictions of the standard model of thin accretion disks to observed optical luminosities of the QSOs to individually estimate their accretion rates. The bolometric luminosity of each QSO is estimated by extrapolating its observed optical luminosities in different bandpasses using empirical panchromatic templates established through various observations. With the estimated accretion rate and bolometric luminosity we obtain the radiation efficiency of each QSO. We find a strong correlation between the radiation efficiency (epsilon) and the black-hole mass, epsilon M.~(0.63), which is similar to the result of Davis & Laor (2011). The estimated radiation efficiency of an individual MBH has a large error which includes errors propagated from various sources. We further discuss various possible biases involved in the estimates of the radiation efficiencies, as these biases potentially contribute to the result epsilon-M. relation. These include the uncertainty of approximating the MBH mass with the estimated Virial mass, the oversimplification of the accretion-disk model,the sample selection effects,and the errors of the estimated bolometric luminosities due to the limited database for templates and unknown dust/gas obscuration.","研究了低红移SDSS类星体(0.025<0.5)的辐射效率。首先利用类星体中心黑洞的质量估计,通过薄盘吸积模型估计了每一个类星体的吸积率。其次根据光学波段的观测光度,利用经验的类星体全波段模板谱估计了每个类星体的热光度。最后由估计的吸积率和热光度得到了每个类星体的辐射效率。发现低红移SDSS类星体的辐射效率与黑洞质量强相关,并满足epsilonM.~(0.63)。这一结果与Davis和Laor(2011)对PG类星体样本得到的结果一致。进一步讨论由于辐射效率估计中各种假设可能引入的偏差及其对epsilon与关M.系的可能影响。"

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：SS433 is a famous high energy source in our Galaxy, W50 is the supernova remnant surrounding it. Since the establishment of the kinematical model of SS433 was suggested in 1970, this system has drawn more and more attention. Multi-band observations have been carried out. and a lot of data has been obtained. But until now, there are still a lot of debates about the essential nature and parameters of this system. For example, the nature of the compact star, the type of the mass donor star, the acceleration and collimation of the jet are not quite certain. In this article, recent progress on the research of SS433 is described. There are three main periodic motions of SS433, the precession of the relativistic jet, the orbital motion of the binary and the nodding of the accretion disk. In section 2.1, more precise parameters of kinematical model from recent observations are given, also the thermal expanding and cooling model of the jet is introduced, which is often used to explain the X-ray emission from the jet. The mass loss process is a very important problem in the study of SS433 and other X-ray binaries. In section 2.2, different kinds of mass loss process are discussed in order to explain the mass loss of SS433. The mass loss rate of stellar wind from the mass donor star may be higher than the mass loss rate of the jet. Disk wind is a little more complicated since it may contain two components, wind vertical to the disk and wind parallel to the disk. The outflow parallel to the disk plane could be observed directly from the high resolution radio observation. From multi-band observations, one can conclude the structure of the disk in different scales, this distorted structure may be related to a lot of observational phenomena of SS433. Since the spatial resolution is limited, variability at different time scales may be the only method to study the fine structure of the central region of SS433. In section 2.3, the problem is discussed, as well as some hot spots like short time scale variability, energy flow with velocity larger than the jet velocity and two kinds of eclipses (secondary eclipse and additional eclipse).

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：Supermassive binary black hole OJ287 is a strong gravitational radiation source.To detect the signal of its gravitational wave,the knowledge of the waveform will be of great help,which is mainly determined by the orbital motion of the binary.For this purpose,we carry out a detailed calculation of the orbital motion of OJ287,using the postNewtonian (PN)approximation up to 3.5th order within the framework of general relativity. Our result is one order higher than the previous work made by others.As a radiation process, there is a time delay from the instance when the secondary black hole impacts on the accretion disk of the primary to the moment of the optical outburst.This time delay has to be taken into account when we try to fit the calculated orbit to the observed outburst times.Adopting a linear relation between the time delay and the impact distance as an empirical model,we fit the calculated orbit to the observed data of the recent seven outbursts of OJ287,obtain the solution of its orbital motion,and give the important orbital properties,including the averaged orbital parameters.By analyzing the result of 3.5PN order calculation of the binary system,we find some interesting features.The precession rate of secondary black hole is shown to increase to a maximum,and then to decrease at late stages,and to eventually turn into a negative value.This result might indicate the breakdown of 3.5PN approximation at late stages when a more accurate calculation is needed. More interestingly,as a main finding of this paper,we discover that the dissipative terms of 2.5th order and 3.5th order have opposite signs.This implies that the 3.5th order term itself does not radiate,but absorbs energy.However,the sum of the two terms still radiates gravitational waves outward.This is confirmed by the change rate of the energy of the system.Our results of the orbit of binary black hole OJ287 up to 3.5PN can be further used to calculate its radiated gravitational waves.","大质量双黑洞OJ287是一个强引力辐射源.为了探测其引力波信号,需要知道波形,而这主要是由轨道运动所决定.为此,从广义相对论3.5阶后牛顿近似的运动方程出发对OJ287的轨道进行仔细研究,取大黑洞位置固定作为近似,给出了后牛顿近似下3.5阶的次黑洞轨道解,比他人2.5阶的工作高了一阶.次黑洞撞击吸积盘面到光学爆发存在时间延迟,这对于确定轨道参数有很大影响.利用径向距离与爆发时间关系的线性模型,对最近7次爆发时刻的观测值拟合,给出了更精确的OJ287双黑洞的轨道参数及其运动轨道.分析了计算结果,研究运动特征,并且发现了两个新性质:次黑洞进动在初期增加,在晚期接近并和时,进动达到最大值,然后减小并越过0而趋于负值.尚不能确定晚期的这个行为是否由3.5阶近似不够准确所造成.运动方程中耗散性的辐射项,后牛顿2.5阶和3.5阶的系数具有相反的符号.这意味着3.5阶项反而是从外界吸收能量.但2.5阶与3.5阶之和仍然是向外辐射引力波的,体系能量变化率为负.这个工作的计算结果可以用来更精确地计算OJ287的引力辐射."

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：The optical variability analysis of quasars based on fractal Brownian motion in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS). The violent activities of the high energy variability can be observed in multiple wavelength bands of quasars, and studying quasar variability can contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism of the emission from the central region. Many studies have shown that the great majority of quasar variability is considered to originate in the accretion disk's thermal emission, but some people do not agree with this view. The Hurst exponent of SDSS quasar variability is calculated using the rescaled range analysis method to investigate the fractal properties of variability in quasars from the SDSS stripe 82. The Hurst exponent results of variability show that the quasar variability is self-similar and long-range correlated. The variability obeys the biased random walk model, and its variation is similar to fractal Brownian motion. The power spectral exponent obtained from the Hurst exponent conversion shows that most of the variabilities can be approximately fitted by the damped random walk model, but a small number of samples have large deviations.","在类星体多个波段都可以观测到剧烈的光变现象, 研究类星体光变有助于更深入地了解其内在的物理机制. 本文从斯隆数字巡天(Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS)项目中选取具有光变的类星体作为分析样本, 采用重标极差方法对SDSS stripe 82天区中的类星体光变的分形特性进行分析. 类星体光变的Hurst指数结果表明: 类星体光变具有自相似性和长程相关性, 存在长期的记忆性和相关性. 类星体光变服从有偏的随机游走模型, 其变化类似于分形布朗运动. 通过Hurst指数转换得到的功率谱指数可知, 大部分类星体的光变曲线可以近似用阻尼随机游走模型来拟合, 但小部分样本存在较大偏差."

By applying the clustering iteration to the outliers mining,a novel outlier iteration algorithm,OIALEVCS,based on large entropy vary and cosine similarity has been formulated. Firstly,the algorithm selects the initial candidate outliers using the area with large entropy vary according to the feature of outliers mining. Secondly,in each iteration the algorithm searches for outliers using cosine similarity as a measure factor. At last,experimental results show that the OIALEVCS algorithm has high efficiency and feasibility by taking late-type stars,high redshift quasars and quasars spectral data as data set. The algorithm takes full advantage of the area with large entropy vary to select the initial candidate outlier object therefore convergence rate is accelerated and the accuracy of outliers mining is improved.","离群数据挖掘是数据挖掘领域中的重要分支之一.将聚类迭代的思想应用到离群数据挖掘中,给出一种基于大熵值变化区域和余弦相似度的离群迭代算法OIALEVCS.该算法首先针对离群挖掘特点,使用大熵值变化区域来选择初始候选离群对象;其次在每次迭代过程中,利用对海量高维数据有效的余弦相似度作为离群度量因子,搜索每个邻域内最离群的对象作为新的候选离群对象,直至迭代收敛;最后采用晚型星、高红移类星体、类星体三个天体光谱数据集,实验验证了算法有效性和可行性.由于该算法充分利用了大熵值变化区域来选择初始候选离群对象,因而进一步加速了迭代收敛的速度,提高了离群挖掘精确度."

The system is also more efficient in observations as the bandwidths of g, r, i bands are much wider than those of the uvbybeta system.

We found 21 steep spectral radio sources with a spectral index less than -0.8, and found that their structure indices at a single band or the both bands are bigger than 3.0, which indicate those sources are not so compact and may not be suitable as defining sources of the ICRF.

Our main results are as follows: (1) Our results support the shock wave interpretation of photovariation (but require oblique shock) or magnetic reconnection interpretation. (2) There is a significant inverse correlation between EC peak luminosity lognu_(EC)~(pk)L_(EC)~(pk) and magnetic field logB. There is a positive correlation between Doppler factor logdelta and EC peak luminosity lognu_(EC)~(pk)L_(EC)~(pk), which means that the increase of Doppler factor is one of the reasons for the increase of EC peak luminosity. (3) There is no significant positive correlation between the synchronous peak frequency lognu_(syn)~(pk) and peak luminosity lognu_(syn)~(pk)L_(syn)~(pk), which means that the sequence of flares may not be valid for all flares. (4) The parameter U_e/U_B (the ratio of relativistic electron energy density to magnetic field energy density) is far from 1, indicating that the equipartition trend between relativistic electron and magnetic field is not obvious, and 86% of parameters U_e/U_B have a ratio greater than 1, which means that most of the jets in 3C 279 are dominated by particles. From the relation of P_B (magnetic field power) < P_r (radiation power)< P_e (relativistic electron power)0.5, it indicates that the energy in 3C 279 jet is also carried by cold protons.

The single-region lepton model under the electron energy spectrum of the steady-state transition power law spectrum is applied.

Our main results are as follows:(1)There is an anticorrelation between magnetic B and Doppler delta in the sample,indicating that magnetic B and Doppler delta are interdependent in the Thomson region.(2)Electron spectral index p_1 supports the interpretation of shock wave or magnetic reconnection during light variation of Mrk 421.(3)There is a positive correlation between the synchronous peak frequency lognu_(syn)~(pk)and the peak luminosity lognu_(syn)~(pk)L_(syn)~(pk),which means that there is an anti-flare variant sequence in the Mrk 421 during the light change.(4)According to the equal partition parameter epsilon = U_e /U_B(the ratio of relativistic electron energy density to magnetic field energy density),the electron energy and magnetic field energy of 26% of the states are nearly equal partition,the electron energy of 63% of the states is an order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field energy,the electron energy of 11% of the states is much larger than the magnetic field energy. This indicates that Mrk 421 is more likely to have the phenomenon that the electron energy is one order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field energy during the light change. It also means that the jets in the Mrk 421 are dominated by particles; From the relationship of P_e>P_B,it is further shown that the Mrk 421 jets are particle-dominated,P_B?P_r,meaning that the Poynting flux cannot account for the radiated power; The ranges of P_r /P_e from 0.01 to 0.51,show that a small fraction of the relativistic electron energy may be used for the observed radiation.(5)Some ranges of the physical parameters of 3C 279 and Mrk 421 may be relatively similar,but the physical processes inside the jets of these two sources may not be the same.","搜集了Mrk 421的光变宽带光谱能量分布(Spectral Energy Distributions,SEDs)数据,共有73个态作为研究样本,使用电子能谱为稳态拐折幂律谱的单区轻子模型进行拟合,进而研究Mrk 421在光变时喷流的物理性质。主要结果如下:(1)样本中磁场B和多普勒因子delta之间显著反相关,说明B和delta在汤姆逊(Thomson)区相互依赖。(2)电子谱指数p_1支持Mrk 421光变时的激波解释或磁重联等解释。(3)同步峰值频率lognu_(syn)~(pk)和峰值光度lognu_(syn)~(pk)L_(syn)~(pk)之间存在正相关关系,意味着Mrk 421在光变时存在反耀变体序列。(4)根据均分参数epsilon = U_e /U_B(相对论电子能量密度与磁场能量密度的比值),有26%的态电子能量和磁场能量接近均分,63%的态电子能量比磁场能量大一个数量级,11%的态电子能量远大于磁场能量,这说明Mrk 421在光变过程中更可能出现电子能量比磁场能量大一个数量级的情况,同时也意味着Mrk 421中的喷流是以粒子为主导; P_e>P_B的关系进一步表明Mrk 421的喷流是以粒子为主导,P_B?P_r意味着坡印廷通量不能解释辐射功率,P_r /P_e的范围为0.01 ~ 0.51,说明相对论电子能量中的一小部分可能用于观测到的辐射。(5)3C 279和Mrk 421的一些物理参数范围可能比较接近,但这两个源喷流内的物理过程可能是不一样的。"
"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：The studies of Active Galactic Nuclei(AGNs)at high redshifts(z 3)have been mostly limited to color selected quasars(QSOs). QSOs are bright and have point-like morphologies, making them easy to be selected in imaging surveys. However, QSOs are the minorities in the full AGN population, as is well studied in the luminosity function of AGNs. The majority of the AGN population--the low-luminosity AGNs(hereafter LLAGNs)--remains largely inaccessible. Throughout this paper, we refer to AGNs that are at least one or two magnitudes fainter than the SDSS-III/BOSS QSOs as LLAGNs. Particularly, the surveys with LLAGNs should be 23 ～ 24 AB mag deep in g-band(-24 ? M_g[z = 3] mag~(-1) ? -23)or deeper(the limiting magnitude for the SDSS-III/BOSS survey is r < 21.85 mag or g < 22 mag)~([10]). LLAGNs are important, for example, for the purpose of constraining the faint end of the luminosity function of AGNs, studying the differences in the fueling mechanisms between weak and strong AGNs, and exploring the potential relationship between supermassive black holes and the large-scale structure in which their host galaxies reside. The sky coverages and the sample sizes of current deep surveys that contain LLAGNs at z 3 are limited(? 2 deg~2, ? 10~2). In this paper, we present both photometric and spectroscopic surveys that include LLAGN samples at z ? 3. We also introduce the HETDEX survey, which will be online in 2017 and will observe more than 104 low-luminosity type 1 AGNs at 2 < z < 4. We summarize these surveys according to their luminosity functions, clustering, and Eddington ratios.

"请用中文介绍以下文本中的内容：The study on optical/UV variability can help to explore the accretion physics for the reason that the emission at optical/UV band is believed to come from a thin accretion disk around the central black hole. However, the origin of variability in radio-quiet quasars remains unclear so far. In 2016, we upgraded the accretion disc model, which assumed the variability is caused by the change of global mass accretion rate, at two points. Firstly, we constrained the disc size to match the viscous timescale of accretion disc to the variability timescale observed. Secondly, we included the irradiation/X-ray reprocessing to make the emitted spectrum become steeper. In this work, we try to further validate the accretion disk-irradiation hybrid model which was produced before. We compile a sample of 465 variable radio-quiet quasars, showing a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend, with multi-epoch observations in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). It is the first time we find the composite relative difference spectra of quasars with a BWB trend is much bluer when the black hole mass is small. In addition, the spectra observed are also found to be bluer for longer time-scale observed, especially at UV band.

Quiescent galaxies at 1 < z < 3 have been found to be more compact than their local counterparts and show a significant structural evolution on redshift. The recent observations show the evidences suggesting that the evolution of high-z compact quiescent galaxies follows an inside-out scenario and the dry minor merger may play a major role. At z > 1, the structural evolution of normal star forming galaxies matches the expectation of hierarchical clustering model. Most of high-z starburst galaxies, including ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) and submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) , show significant merging morphological features, suggesting that major mergers are probably the main triggering mechanism of starburst activities. Morphological studies of high-z active galactic nucleus (AGNS) host galaxies reveal a mixed result. X-ray-selected AGNs with moderate luminosities do not show an enhanced merger fraction than normal galaxies. However, luminous quasars seem to have a high merger fraction.

In order to test these models,we collect the VLBI observations for a sample of Blazars. Totaly,the sample consists of 108 Blazars(86 FSRQs and 22 BL Lac objects).We calculate the apparent speed of all radio knots in the sample and statistically study the locations of knots with the maximum apparent speed of each Blazar in the sample.The results show that the location of the radio knots with the maximum apparent speed decreases with the decrease of the radio luminosity of Blazars,from FSRQs to LBLs to IBLs to HBLs,with the radio luminosity decreases, the distance of the radio knots with the maximum apparent speed from the core in the plane of sky gets shorter and shorter,implying that HBL jets have the shortest accelerate region.That is to say,the jet decelerating region locates near the core in Blazar with low luminosity,and the jet has decelerated from TeV-emitting region to the scale that VLBI can resolve,consistent with the deceleration model.","VLBI观测表明,TeV伽马射线Blazar(耀变体)的喷流运动视速度远小于MeV/GeV伽马射线Blazar,然而TeV伽马射线辐射流量的快速变化却要求这些Blazar的相对论喷流速度与MeV/GeV Blazar的相当.对于这一矛盾,目前有多种解释.为了检验这些模型,我们收集了VLBI对Blazar喷流运动的监测数据,样本包括86个FSRQs(平谱射电类星体)、22个BL Lac天体,共108个Blazar;从统计上研究了,该样本中各Blazar最大视速度喷流节点的位置与射电光度相关关系.结果表明,Blazar最大视速度喷流节点的位置与射电光度有较强的相关关系,随着Blazar射电光度的减小,喷流中最大视速度VLBI节点的位置到VLBI核的距离逐渐变小.这意味着,TeV伽马源(低光度Blazar)的喷流减速区距离VLBI核较近,喷流从高能辐射区到VLBI可分辨尺度已经减速,支持减速喷流模型对TeV伽马射线Blazar上述矛盾的解释."

Both spectral energy distributions(SEDs) of synchrotron and inverse Compton(IC) components are fitted by a log-parabolic law in lg nu - lg nuf_v diagram. The second-degree term of log-parabolic measures the curvature of SED. Our main intent is to explore the curvature properties of spectral energy distribution of Fermi blazars.

Comparing our observational results and the theoretical predictions of different models, we find that the observational results of FSRQs are consistent with the fluctuation of fractional acceleration gain model, while the observational results of BL Lacs are consistent with the energy-dependent acceleration probability model. The mean value of synchrotron curvature of FSRQs is larger than that of BL Lacs, which suggests the particle acceleration efficiency of BL Lacs is higher than that of FSRQs. It should be attributed to the jet plasma of FSRQs dissipated within the broad-line region(BLR) and suffered stronger cooling. We also find that FSRQs and Low-energy peaked BL Lacs(LBLs) have similar SED properties, which is consistent with previous results.

This prediction has been verified by the laboratory experiments in the optical waveband. In this paper, we present the basic formula for calculating the intensity ratio and the intrinsic redshift ratio of the Cerenkov iron Ka and Kbetalines. Using these formulae, we calculate the intensity ratios and the redshift ratios of the Cerenkov iron Ka and Kbetalines for different valences of iron ions, which can be examined by the observations of AGNs. The recent observations show that, except for the iron Kalphaline at～6. 4 keV, there is also an apparent iron Kbetaline at～7. 0 keV in NGC 3783 with intensity markedly higher than the predicted one by the traditional fluorescence emission.

This is the most violently rapid variability in our optical monitoring program for blazars since 1982. For this source, some physical parameters, namely the emission size, Doppler factor delta, the efficiency (eta) for conversion of accreted matter into energy and luminosity re calculated. Aeta = 59.6 was obtained, strongly implying that the relativistic beaming is responsible for the rapid variability of the gamma-ray loud source. The influence of variable seeing conditions on the observations was carefully investigated.

Thereafter, we discuss their physical implications, the theoretic interpretations and the indications on the inner structures of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Narrow-line Serfert Galaxies (NSL1s) are identified as the Narrow Hbetapermitted emission lines in their optical spectra,in which the properties of Seyfert I and II galaxies are presented partically. NLS1s with the strongest optical FeII line blends and weak [O III] forbidden lines, obviously differe from Seyfert II galaxies. Classified as the subclass of normal Seyfert I galaxies, NSL1s have the extreme properties of the observational parameters in Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Therefore, they are the primary objects to understand the characteristics and structures of board emission line region and the innermost machines surrounding the central black hole. By means of PCA, NLSI_s locate in the extreme end of the Board-line AGNs, such as (1) the narrowest H_beta line, (2) the largest ratio of Fe II lambda4507/H_beta, (3) the largest ratio of Si III] lambda1892/C III]lambda1909 indicating electron density of board line clouds in a certain range, (4) the largest C IVlambda1549 emission line blueshfit, (5) the steepest soft X-ray photon spectrum index, (6) the giant amplitude of the soft X-ray excess variance.

They are important to probe the dense matter equation of state and the effects of strong gravity, to study the high magnetic field environment on the neutron star surface. The studies of X-ray burst oscillations are also crucial to understand the spinup process of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries through accretion and the evolution into millisecond pulsars. The different characteristics of burst oscillation signals between persistent accretion-powered pulsars, intermittent accretion-powered pulsars and sources without detectable accretion-powered pulsations can help us to study more about it.

However, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy around saturation density is still rather uncertain.

The cyclotron resonant scattering feature ( CRSF) at energies from 35-47 keV was detected in the hard X-ray spectra,suggesting the magnetic field of 5*10~(12) Gs. The variations of the CRSF show no relation to the X-ray luminosity while the line centroid energy of the CRSF has a positive correlation to the photon index and spectral cutoff energy,and there also exists a weak correlation between the absorption depth and cutoff energy. These relations support the idea that the spectral cutoff in accreting X-ray pulsars is strongly affected by the cyclotron resonant scattering. The correlation between the ratio of the line width to the centroid energy and absorption depth implies a tall cylindrical accreting column on the surface of the neutron star in GX 301-2. The explanation of the long spin period in GX 301-2 requires a strong surface magnetic field at least higher than 2*10~(14) Gs which is contradict with the measured value based on the cyclotron line energy. The line-forming region with a height at least larger than two neutron star radii is proposed to resolve the contradiction. This scenario is supported by the tall cylindrical accreting column on the neutron star surface in GX 301-2 according to the variation patterns of the CRSF. In addition,the possible evolution scenario of accreting magnetars like GX 301-2 is briefly discussed,and GX 301-2 would be an accreting magnetar in the equivalence phase."

Therefore, these merger events are the most important targets of current multi-messenger astronomical studies. The thermal transient emission from a merger ejecta is called a kilonova or, more generally, a mergernova, which is powered by the radioactive decays of r-process elements, and the energy injection from the central merger product. This phenomenon was first predicted theoretically by Li and Paczynski in 1998, and confirmed by the optical-infrared observations in the GW170817 event in 2017. As a result, the kilonova/mergernova observation had played a crucial role in locating GW170817, identifying its astrophysical origin, and even constraining the nature of the merger product of this event. This paper briefly reviews the primary progress of kilonova/mergernova researches, including the initiative, improvements, and developments of the model and the observational discoveries of candidates and the optical electromagnetic counterpart of GW170817."

Based on the collection of the orbital parameters of 40 systems (46 sources), we apply the boot-strap method together with the Monte Carlo method to reconstruct the likelihood curves for each source separately. The cumulative analysis of the simulation result shows that the neutron star masses in X-ray systems and radio systems obey different distributions, and no evidence for the bimodal distribution could be found. Employing the Bayesian statistical techniques, we find that the most likely distributions for the high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), double neutron star (DNS) systems, and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) binary systems are (1.3400.230) M_⊙,(1.5050.125) M_⊙, (1.3350.055) M_⊙, and (1.4950.225) M_⊙, respectively. The statistical distribution has no significant deviation from the standard neutron star formation mechanism. It is noticed that the statistical results of the center masses of LMXBs and NS-WD systems are significantly higher than the other groups by about 0.16 M_⊙, which could be regarded as the evidence of accretion episodes. And if we regard the HMXBs and LMXBs as the progenitors of DNS and NS-WD systems, then we can draw the conclusion that the accretion effect must be very week during the evolution trajectory from HMXBs to DNS systems, and this could be the reason why the masses of DNS systems have such a narrow distribution."

Most studies in this area focus on the influence of extremely high temperatures and baryon densities on matter properties, especially pertaining to phase transitions such as the chiral symmetry breaking and color superconductivity. Recent experimental and theoretical studies reported that in non-central heavy-ion collisions, systems carry a large initial angular momentum that becomes very strong vorticity fields in the bulk fluid. This has thus introduced several new questions regarding the properties of strong interaction matter under vorticity fields, and have led to many novel results. Thermal field theory calculations based on rotating frame and mean-field approximation have been developed to study various phase transitions under rotation, such as chiral symmetry breaking, color superconductivity and superfluidity at high isospin asymmetry. The results have demonstrated important impacts of vorticity fields on the phase boundaries of these transitions, and have also revealed nontrivial new phase structures of strong interaction matter under rotation.

And according to the constraint of the neutron star observation on the parameter of non-Newtonian gravity, the constraint on the boundary of the instability window is also given. It is found that a stronger non-Newtonian gravity corresponds with a wider r-mode instability window. These results may provide interesting reference for the gravitational wave detection."

The structure of NDAF around the strange star is calculated. Different from other central compact stars, the strange star will feed back phase transition energy of strangization to the accretion flow, with neutrinos as its carriers. The friction between NDAF and the strange star is ignored in this paper. The results are indicated as follows: Firstly, the structure of NDAF around strange star is sensitive to accretion rate; Secondly, if accretion rate is larger than 0.18 M⊙・s~(-1), the strange star - NDAF model can unify the prompt emission and post prompt activity of gamma-ray bursts.

Besides the event-by-event fluctuation of conserved charges, which has been widely accepted as a useful study of the QCD critical point, the production of light nuclei can serve as a sensitive observable to the QCD phase transitions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The density fluctuation and correlation among nucleons are automatically encoded in the production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions. This study aims to demonstrate how to probe QCD phase transition with light nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions. The progress of studies in this area over the last few years is reviewed. The nucleon coalescence model provides a suitable tool for the study of the effects of density fluctuation/correlation on light nuclei production. A transport model based on the Nambu-Jona- Lasinio (NJL) model is developed to simulate the occurrence of the first-order chiral phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model for light nuclei production, the yield ratio N_tN_p/N_d~2 of protons (p), deuterons (d), and tritons (t) is shown to be sensitive to the nucleon density fluctuation and correlation and can function as a good probe to the non-smooth QCD phase transition. The production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions encodes the information about baryon density fluctuations and correlations, and enhancements of the yield ratio N_tN_p/N_d~2 could serve as an indicator for the occurrence of a first-order or second-order QCD phase transition."

By using this mechanism, some puzzles in the study of GRBs could be clarified,e.g., the origin of the Amati relation, the formation of the observed broken power-law spectra, the related deadline problem, the polarization property, etc. The simplified analytical formulae of collective RICS spectra of the assembly of relativistic electrons in an intense magnetic field are derived in this paper, based on the simple RICS power spectra of a single fast electron given in our previous work. By using these formulae,a series of collective RICS spectra for various typical ambient low-frequency radiation fields around the central neutron star,e.g., the black body radiation, the nonthermal field with a power-law spectrum and the thermal bremsstrahlung field, are calculated. The collective RICS spectra are all in quite simple analytical expressions, which are convenient for comparison with the observed spectra. Our calculations show that the RICS process is really a very efficient radiation mechanism in the hard X-ray andgamma-ray bands if theaccommodation condition(or thematching condition) is satisfied.

For the purpose of the practical applications of the RICS process, in this paper, we present a basic formula of the collective RICS spectrum for an assembly of relativistic electrons moving along the direction of near-magnetic axis of a strongly magnetized neutron star or strange star. The derivation of the formula is based on the simple RICS emission spectrum of a single fast electron given in our previous paper (you et al. 2003). By using this basic formula, we calculate a series of collective RICS spectra for various typical ambient low-frequency radiation fields around the central neutron star, e.g. the bremsstrahlung, the black body radiation, and the nonthermal field with power law form spectrum, etc. We thus obtain the collective RICS spectra in quite simple analytical expressions, which is in favor of the comparison with the observed spectra.

We show that various RICS spectra have a common broken power-law form (different power-laws in two sections), despite of the form of the ambient low-frequency field.

In this work, We analyze the influence of delta mesons on the equation of states, the maximum mass, the tidal Love numbers and the tidal deformabilities for the conventional neutron stars and the hyperon stars within the relativistic mean field theory. It is found that the presence of delta mesons can strengthen the tidal deformabilities of the low and medium-mass conventional neutron stars (or hyperon stars). However, the strengthening trends of the tidal deformabilities with delta mesons gradually weaken with the increase of the mass of the conventional neutron stars (or hyperon stars). Especially for massive hyperon stars, the tidal deformabilities of the superstars with delta mesons is weaker than the corresponding values without delta mesons. Moreover, the presence of hyperons can reduce the tidal deformabilities of stars with the same mass. For the stars containing delta mesons, only the tidal deformabilities in the hyperon stars with Lambda, Sigma and Xi hyperons can satisfy the constraints of GW170817 and GW190814 events under the parameters selected in the paper.

Different sources produce the gravitational waves at quite different frequencies, which can be detected by different methods. In the lowest frequency range (f < 10~(-15) Hz), the detection is mainly dependent of the observation of B-mode polarization of cosmic microwave background radiation. In the middle frequency range (10~(-9) < f < 10~(-6) Hz), one detects gravitational waves by analyzing the timing residuals of millisecond second pulsars. In the high frequency range (10~(-4) < f < 10~4 Hz), it can be detected by space-based and ground-based laser interferometers. In particular, we focus on the main features, detection methods, detection status and the future prospects for several important sources, including the continuous sources (e.g. spinning neutron stars, stable binary systems), the burst sources (e.g. supernovae, the mergence of binary system), and the stochastic backgrounds generated by the astrophysical and cosmological process.

This paper analyzes the space distributions and the physical properties such as the spin periods of the 34 sources under the death line, i.e., the radio pulsars with a low spin-down energy loss rate. Firstly, these pulsars are all in the galactic field, which show no obvious correlation with the special types of pulsars and the pulsars with a high-energy radiation; Secondly, these pulsars locate in the low galactic latitude and near the solar system; Thirdly, these pulsars show the relative larger characteristic ages and larger spin periods; Last, the radio luminosity of 1400 MHz and the spin-down power E of these pulsars show a weak correlation. We argue that the radio pulsars with a low spin-down power may loss energy due to radiation, causing the deceleration of the spin, whose E decreases below the death line. We suggest that the survey for the radio pulsars with a low spin-down power should focus on the old and long spin period radio sources in the galactic field, and it is unnecessary to focus on the special type of the pulsars or the certain spatial positions.

Secondly, we analyze the possible binary evolution process of CCOs based on recycling theory of the neutron stars: in the binary, a CCO can accrete the ?M ~ 10 - 2 M_⊙ matter with the accretion rate of M ~ 10~(17) g・s~(-1) during the time of ~ 10~6 yrs, then its spin period will decrease from P ~ 10 s to P ~ 0.1 s, and its surface magnetic field strength will decrease from B ~ 10~(12) Gs to B ~ 10~(10) Gs. Considering that the evolution timescale of ~ 10~6 yr is far longer than the age of the SNRs containing CCOs (~ 0.3-7 kyr), we suppose that CCOs may be the products of the supernova of the first star in the binary, and the binary is disintegrated during the supernova of the second star, which leaves a CCO and the SNR of the second star. This model predicts that there may exit a young normal pulsar near the CCO (P ~ 0.02 s, B ~ 10~(12) Gs), and we expect that the radio telescope and high energy detector can survey these sources in the future."

The influences of containing of strongly or weakly interacting dark matter to global observational features of hybrid stars, mass, radius, gravitational red-shift, rotational period and moment of inertia are studied by using relativistic mean field theory to describe hadron phase, effective mass bag model to quark phase, and Gibbs phase equilibrium conditions to hadron-quark mixed phase respectively. Our results indicate that, both in the strong and weak interacting case, the equation of state for hybrid star matter contain dark matter become softer than that of without dark matter while the mass of dark matter particles larger than 0.5 GeV, which leads to the decrease of the mass and corresponding radius of hybrid star. With the increase of the dark matter particle mass, the equation of state for hybrid star matter become softer, this cause the decrease of the mass and radius of hybrid star obviously. The gravitational red-shift and the rotational period, obviously increase of the moment of inertia of the hybrid stars are influenced by the dark matter particle mass. When the dark matter particle mass is equal to 0.1 GeV, the masses of the star with strong and weak interacting dark matter reach to 2.0 M_⊙ and 2.8 M_⊙ (M_⊙ is the solar mass), this result indicates that the giant mass PSR, J1859-0131 and J1931-01, can be a hadron-quark hybrid star and containing dark matter with small dark particle mass. The computational results of all above global observational features of hybrid stars are in the range of astronomical observation data, these also indicate that hybrid star with quark core may contains dark matter."

Around saturation density, both the value and the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy have been roughly constrained, its high-density behavior is now still in argument. Probing high-density symmetry energy at terrestrial laboratories is being carried out at facilities that offer radioactive beams worldwide. While relevant experiments are being conducted, we theoretically developed more advanced isospin-dependent transport model including new physics such as nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations and in-medium isospin-dependent baryon-baryon scattering cross section. New sensitive probes of the high-density symmetry energy are provided, such as squeezed-out neutron to proton ratio, photon and light cluster as well as the production of mesons with strangeness or hidden strangeness. The blind spots of probing the high-density symmetry energy by sensitive observable are demonstrated. Model dependences of frequently used sensitive probes of the symmetry energy have been studied thoroughly based on different transport models. A qualitative observable of neutron to proton ratio at high kinetic energy is proposed to probe the high-density symmetry energy qualitatively. The probed density regions of the symmetry energy by some observables are first studied and usually lower probed density regions comparing with maximum compression density are obtained. Nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations usually reduce values of sensitive observables of the symmetry energy. Probing the curvature of the symmetry energy by involving the slope information of the symmetry energy at saturation point in the transport model is proposed. Besides constraining the high-density symmetry energy by using heavy-ion collisions, a lot of neutron-star related observations from heaven may also be used to constrain the high-density symmetry energy."

The braking index exactly equal to 3 in pure magnetodipole radiation model, however, all the observed braking index of rotationpowered pulsars is less than 3. This indicates that the additional energy loss ways must exist besides the magnetodipole radiation. The magnetodipole radiation, the ejection of particle outflow and quantum vacuum friction are considered as the source of the loss of rotational kinetic energy of rotation-powered pulsars. Based on the three mechanism of loss of the energy, the relation between the period of pulsars and the first derivative of the period to time and the pulsars energy losing power are given.

NS质量的双峰结构显示出,其可能有两种诞生方式.认为可能是铁核塌缩超新星爆发和电子俘获超新星爆发.DNS质量的单峰结构意味着DNS诞生演化机制可能与其他双星系统不同.为了进一步研究中子星质量分布的特性,将53颗测量到自旋周期的NS在20 ms处分为两组,分别为毫秒中子星(MSP,P_s≤20 ms)和正常中子星(PSR,P_s>20 ms),发现这两类NS质量也都呈现出双峰分布,而且MSP的平均质量要比PSR的平均质量大~0.22 M_⊙.这表明NS在诞生后吸积约0.22 M_⊙的物质时,将可能成为MSP.根据NS质量与周期在M-Ps图上的分布,拟合出质量与周期之间的关系为:M = 1.4 + (P_s/ms)~(-3/2) M_⊙.","The measured masses of 72 neutron stars (NSs) in 63 pairs of binary systems are studied in this paper, including 18 X-ray binary systems (XBs), 9 double neutron star systems (DNSs), 4 neutron star-main sequence binary systems (NSMSs), and 32 neutron star-white dwarf binary systems (NSWDs). We use the method of Monte-Carlo random sampling to deal with the uncertainty of measured masses to increase the accuracies of statistical results. We find that the measured masses have a bimodal distribution, with the first peak around (1.3280.220) M_⊙, and a much wider second peak at (1.7730.416) M_⊙,respectively. It is worth noting that, even though the DNSs are excluded, the mass distribution is still bimodal and peaked respectively at (1.3600.337) M_⊙ and (1.8540.322) M_⊙. The average mass of 18 DNSs is(1.3300.0089) M_⊙. Through the above mass distribution, it can be clearly seen that DNS has a little influence on the mass distribution of NS, and the distribution of NS mass also implies that there are two birth modes of NSs. We think that they are the nuclear collapse supernova explosion and the electron capture supernova eruption. The single peak structure of DNS mass implies that the evolution mechanism of DNS may be different from other binary systems. In order to further study the characteristics of neutron star mass distribution, we divide the 53 NSs with measured mass into two groups, the millisecond neutron star (MSP, the spin period P_s ≤ 20 ms) and normal neutron star (PSR, Ps > 20 ms). We find that their mass distributions also show the bimodal structure, and the average mass of MSP is ~0.22 M_⊙ larger than the average mass of PSR. This indicates that the spin of NS will reach milliseconds after the accretion of about 0.22 M_⊙. According to the distribution of NS mass and period on the M-Ps diagram, the fitting results of the M-Ps relation is M = 1.4 + (P_s/ms)~(-3/2) M_⊙."

The equation of state (EOS) of NSs plays a crucial role in the present multimessenger astronomy, especially after the event of GW170817.

The appearance of strange baryonic matter and strange quark matter are also discussed. We compare the theoretical predictions with different data coming from both nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. Despite great progresses obtained in dense nuclear matter properties, there are various challenges ahead, such as the model dependence of the constraints extracted from either experimental or observational data, the lack of a consistent and rigorous many-body treatment of all parts of the star, the dependence of many observables on the turbulent dynamics of relevant hot dense system.

A short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and a kilonova were detected 1.74 s and 10.9 h after the GW signal, respectively. These detections confirm the hypothesis that at least some short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) originate from binary neutron star mergers.

Due to the uncertainties reside in model assumptions and parameters,the matter state and composition of dense matter are still unclear and exhibit large ambiguities, leading to large uncertainties in the corresponding EoSs.The measurements of neutron star properties in multi-messenger era,on the other hand,have placed a stringent constraint on its EoS.For example,the measurements of 2 M_⊙ pulsars have ruled out various soft EOSs for dense stellar matter.Based on the multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817,the tidal deformability of 1.4 M_⊙ neutron star is believed to lie within 70≤Lambda1.4≤580with the corresponding radii R=(11.91.4)km,excluding the EoSs which are too stiff at small densities.The masses and radii of the two millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451and PSR J0740+6620 were measured accurately via pulse-profile modeling with NICER and XMM-Newton data,where similar radii(about 12.4km)were obtained despite their large differences in masses.This reduces the likelihood of a strong first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with masses M≤2 M_⊙.Adopting various EoS parameterizations which are either phenomenological or nuclear physics-motivated,extensive investigations were carried out by applying those observational data to constraining the EoSs and neutron star properties with Bayesian parameter estimation.On the other hand,as proposed by Biswas,one can take a complementary approach to estimate statistically the most preferred EoS according to the current observations.In light of the recently obtained 10 unified neutron star EoSs using relativistic mean field models with nonlinear self couplings(NL3,PK1,TM1,GM1,and MTVTC)and density-dependent couplings (DD-LZ1,DDME-X,PKDD,DD-ME2,and TW99),combined with the other 6unified EoSs(FSU2,DD2,NL3wr-L55,FSU2R,FSU2H,and TM1e)which were obtained in a similar manner,those EoS models then can be studied for Bayesian model selection, which is not included in Biswass original study.In this work,a Bayesian model selection on the 16unified neutron star EoSs predicted by relativistic mean field models is thus performed,which are available on CompOSE.In particular,the tidal deformability measurements were used from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817and the simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451and PSR J0740+6620by the NICER collaboration.The most preferred EoS model is DD2,which predicts the radius and tidal deformability of a 1.4 M_⊙neutron star to be 13.19km and 687,respectively. The selected EoS models that are not ruled out by observation can then be ordered with respect to the relative odds ratio:DD2,TW99,DD-LZ1,DD-ME2, TM1e,FSU2H,DDME-X,PKDD,FSU2R,and MTVTC.These EoSs predict that the radii and tidal deform abilities of 1.4 M_⊙ neutron stars should lie within 12.3-13.6km and 400-784,while the maximum masses range from 2.02 M_⊙to 2.56 M_⊙."

In particular, the process of observing the peculiar pulsars and their systems, such as sub-millisecond pulsars, binary neutron star systems, neutron star-black hole systems, etc., has played a very important role in understanding the evolution of stars and the true internal structure of neutron stars. For example, the extremely high rotation frequencies of sub-millisecond pulsars may play a key role in constraining the equation of state of neutron stars and verifying the evolution of structure and mechanism in the rapidly rotating neutron stars. The researches of the macroscopic properties of sub-millisecond pulsars can provide important clues to whether quark matter can appear in sub-millisecond pulsars, and whether there is an association between the mass range of sub-millisecond pulsars and the possible mass gaps of neutron stars and black holes. The discovery of peculiar pulsars and their systems can promote astronomical observations to find the effective ways to distinguish neutron stars from quark stars. The measuring the surface gravitational redshift of neutron stars provides a potential method for constraining or estimating the mass and radius of neutron stars.

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：Glitch指脉冲星发生的自转角速度突然增大的现象,在许多脉冲星中都探测到了。Glitch的产生机制与脉冲星内部结构相关,而后者依然是待解决的难题。天文观测和理论研究均不能排除一类可能性,即脉冲星类天体本质上是固态夸克集团星,而固态星体发生Glitch的最自然的解释就是星震。本工作在星震模型下研究了固态脉冲星的Glitch现象。固态星体在自转减慢过程中,会发生应力能(或弹性能)的积累,当积累的应力超过星体能承受的限度,星体会发生碎裂,即发生星震,此时由于转动惯量突然减小而导致自转角速度突然增大,表现为Glitch现象。根据此模型可得到Glitch的幅度与时间间隔的关系。如果星体的质量较大而自转较慢,星震过程可能同时伴随体积的减小,即体积改变的星震,此时通常会有显著的引力能释放,可以解释观测到的反称X射线脉冲星/软伽马射线重复暴(AXPs/SGRs);如果星体转速较快,星震过程可能只表现为形状即扁率的微小变化,此时不会有显著的能量释放。这两类Glitches可以解释观测现象。进一步的理论研究结合更多观测,有望使人们利用Glitch现象来检验固态夸克集团星这一理论猜想。","The author demonstrates that how to understand the Glitches of solid pulsars in the starquake model. Glitch is the sudden spin-up during the normal spin-down process,which has been observed in many pulsars. The mechanism of Glitches is still a matter of debate because it depends on the unsolved problem that what is the nature of pulsars. One of the models of pulsars,the so-called solid quark-cluster stars,could not be ruled out by neither the astrophysics observations nor theoretical considerations. The Glitches of solid quarkcluster stars could naturally be the result of starqukes. During the spinning-down of the solid star,the strain energy develops until the stress reaches the critical value,then some parts of the star fragment,which would suddenly decrease the moment of inertia of the star,leading to the sudden increase of the rotation frequency that manifests as a Glitch. If the star has high mass or rotates slowly,the shrink of radius would happen during the starquake,leading to a huge amount of energy releasing which accounts for AXPs/SGRs. On the other hand,if the star rotates fast,only the oblateness of the star changes during the starquake,which would lead to negligible releasing of energy. This paper discusses the phenomenon of Glitches for solid quark-cluster stars,including the physical processes and consequences of starquakes,as well as the reasons for different energy releasing during Glitches. Further theoretical study combined with more observations about Glitches would be helpful for us to test the conjecture of sold quark-clusters."

Pulsar's rotational energy is able to compensate for the energy emitted by the electromagnetic radiations, which deduces a gradual slow down of the pulsar spin velocity. According to the theoretical derivation, we predict the initial period of the Crab Nebula pulsar, and derive the period evolution at any time in the future under the effect of electromagnetic radiations. Since there is a quadrupole deformation of the mass distribution of pulsars, the gravitational wave radiation will reduce the rotational speed of the pulsar. Hence, the influence of gravitational waves on the spin period of Crab pulsar is taken into account for a further analysis. Finally, two models of radiation mechanism are combined, and the evolution of spin period of the pulsar is studied."

Further calculation shows that the progenitor mass of the companion is about 1.57 M⊙, and it has lost 0.23 M⊙ during the formation of the DNS system. This may be caused by that the electron capture energy is so low that it can not compete with the gravitational binding energy of the progenitor, and eventually the ejecta is bound to form a ring.

请用英文重写以下论文摘要：尽管物质世界以不熟悉的暗物质、暗能量为主，但自然界的精彩却要归功于相对少量的那些重子物质.日常生活中原子核之间Coulomb排斥有效地阻止它们通过挤压物质而聚合起来，然而天体极端环境时常出人意料：大质量恒星演化至晚期时，其核心引力如此之强以至于其他任何力（当然包括 Coulomb排斥)都难以媲美压缩重子物质就这样在超新星爆发过程中诞生，并表现为观测到的脉冲星.对这类压缩重子物质的研究将不仅加深对强作用基本性质的认识，而且有助于检验引力理论、探测低频引力波、建立精确的时间标准和导航体系，还是我国在建或拟建大型天文望远镜的核心课题.历史上Landau曾推测恒星核心存在巨大的原子核(后来发展成为中子星模型)，我们经过研究后却认为脉冲星其实是由夸克集团而构成的凝聚体.夸克集团作为超新星爆发形成压缩重子物质的基本单元这一想法十年来并未被观测排除，而且我们还期待未来功能更强大的观测设备检验它.,"Our world is wonderful because of the negligible baryonic part although unknown dark matter and dark energy dominate the Universe. Those nuclei in the daily life are forbidden to fuse by compression due to the Coulomb repulse, nevertheless, it is usually unexpected in extraterrestrial extreme-environments: the gravity in a core of massive evolved star is so strong that all the other forces (including the Coulomb one) could be neglected. Compressed baryonic matter is then produced after supernova, manifesting itself as pulsar-like stars observed. The study of this compressed baryonic matter can not only be meaningful in fundamental physics (e.g., the elementary color interaction at low-energy scale, testing gravity theories, detecting nano-Hertz background gravitational waves), but has also profound implications in engineering applications (including time standard and navigation), and additionally, is focused by Chinese advanced telescopes, either terrestrial or in space. Historically, in 1930s, L. Landau speculated that dense matter at supra-nuclear density in stellar cores could be considered as gigantic nuclei (the prototype of standard model of neutron star), however, we address that the residual compact object of supernova could be of condensed matter of quark clusters. The idea that pulsars are quark-cluster stars was not ruled out during the last decade, and we are expecting to test further by future powerful facilities."

Through measuring the times of arrival of pulsars, a surprisingly large amount of information can be obtained, such as, providing precise information on rotational slowdown of pulsars, testing the general relativity and gravitational waves, detecting exoplanets, determining fundamental parameters of binary systems, and also providing time standard with stabilities comparable to that of the best atomic clocks. The angular momentum of an isolated pulsar only changes through the braking torque of the magnetic dipole radiation; therefore, the effect on the pulse times of arrival would be usually predictable and smooth. However, two interesting irregularities in pulsar rotation have been observed. The first kind is `glitches' which sudden increases in their rotation rates followed by a period of relaxation. Glitches occur more frequently in younger pulsars, but have also been observed in millisecond pulsars. The other behavior is known as `timing noise', which is a continuous but erratic behaviour relative to a simple slow down model and consists of low-frequency structures. The pulsars have large period derivatives generally show more prominent timing noise. A more complete understanding of pulsar timing noise will provide us an insight into the interior structure of neutron stars. In this paper, the pulsar spin-down model is reviewed and analyzed. An overview of observational progress of timing noise of pulsars in recent years is provided, in light that many observatories worldwide have been developed and operated. On the basis of existing observation data, some problems of classification of timing noise and observational braking index, which can not be explained by the simple spin-down model, are discussed in detail. Moreover, many models for timing noise are introduced, including physical and phenomenological models. In the last, further developments and prospects in this area are also outlooked."
"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：对称能的密度依赖形式对于中子星结构及其演化规律、不稳定核结构及其反应等都有非常重要的影响。由于目前理论上预言的对称能密度依赖形式有很大的不确定性，因此确定对称能的密度依赖形式已经成为目前核物理研究的一个重要课题。丰中子核重离子碰撞是目前在实验室条件下确定对称能密度依赖形式的一种重要手段，其主要的理论依据就是微观输运理论。首先回顾了目前输运理论的两个处理方法，即Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck(BUU)和量子分子动力学(QMD)方法，并重点介绍了改进的量子分子动力学模型(ImQMD05)。利用ImQMD05对中能重离子碰撞的一些基本观测量，如碎块分布、集体流、核核碰撞的阻止本领等进行了详细研究，通过与实验数据的比较，确定了ImQMD05中同位旋无关部分的平均场、介质中核子-核子散射截面。为了从重离子碰撞的实验数据确定对称能的密度依赖形式，详细研究了输运理论中对称势以及同位旋相关的介质中核子-核子散射截面对于同位旋敏感观测量的影响。研究显示，对于Fermi能附近的重离子碰撞，输运理论预言的同位旋敏感的观测量，如DR(n/p)和R_i，强烈依赖于对称势的软硬，而不敏感于介质中同位旋相关的核子-核子散射截面。多重碎裂作为中能重离子碰撞的一个主要特点，本文论述的研究显示碎块发射机制对同位旋敏感的观测量，出射核子的双中子质子之比DR(n/p)和同位旋转移之比R_i，都有重要影响。以重碎块的同位旋不对称度为探针得到的同位旋转移之比R_i（deltaz_(max)>20）要大于R_i(delta)，这些测量能够在NSCL/RIKEN的相关实验上进行测量。同时，这一现象的研究对于理解碎块的发射机制及碎块发射的特征时间等问题将有重要的帮助。为此，采用ImQMD05研究了~(112,124)Sn+~(112,124)Sn在入射能量50MeV/u，不同碰撞参数条件下的多个实验观测量，如DR(n/p)、同位旋扩散R_i，以及同位旋转移之比的快度分布。研究表明，模型能够同时自洽地解释这几个实验观测量，并通过与这些实验数据的分析比较，自洽地确定出低密区对称能密度依赖形式的范围。","Nuclear symmetry energy plays an important role in the properties of nuclei and neutron stars. Since theoretical predictions of the density dependence of symmetry energy S(p) from microscopic nucleon- nucleon interactions show large uncertainties, especially in the region of suprasaturation density, constraining the density dependence of symmetry energy has become one of the main goals in nuclear physics and has stimulated many theoretical and experimental studies. In this paper, we have reviewed the ImQMD05 code and its description on charge distribution, collective flow and nuclear-nuclear stopping. By comparing ImQMD05 prediction with data, the isoscalar part of nucleonic mean field, the energy and density dependence of inmedium NN cross sectoin in the ImQMD05 were determined. In order to extracting the symmetry energy information by comparing the ImQMD05 calculations with the data for ~(112, 124) Sn+~(112, 124) Sn at E_(beam) = 50 MeV/u, the influence of symmetry potential and in-medium NN cross section on the isospin sensitive observables of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions was investigated. Focusing on the region above the Fermi energy, our results show that the symmetry potential plays a more important role in the experimental observables, such as double neutron to proton ratio and the isospin transport ratio R_i, than that the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section does. Since the copious production of intermediate mass fragments is a distinguishing feature of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, we also examined the influence of cluster emission on the isospin transport ratio using different isospin tracers. The values of the isospin transport ratios with the tracer defined by the isospin asymmetry of the heaviest fragments with Z ≥20 in the projectile region is greater than those obtained from projectile residues (emitting source). This phenomenon can be tested experimentally. By comparing the ImQMD05 predictions with the data for three observables, the self-consistent constraints on the symmetry energy at subsaturation density were obtained."

At present, there is still great uncertainty in the understanding of the high-density asymmetric nuclear matter through the terrestrial experiments, such as the heavy ion collisions. With the improvement of astronomical observation accuracy and the increase of observable measurements of neutron stars, it is possible to reverse constraint the state of high-density nuclear matter based on astronomical observation of neutron stars. Theoretically investigating the correlation between the observable measurements of neutron stars and the equation of states (EOSs) at different density sections will be helpful to the research of the reverse constraints. In this work, by employing the piecewise polytrope EOSs, the observable measurements of the radius(R), tidal deformability(Lambda), moment of inertia(I) of the neutron star. are calculated and analyzed, and the correlations between these observations and each density segment of the EOSs are given. The results show that tidal deformability (Lambda) and f-mode frequency (v) of a canonical neutron star (M=1.4M⊙) are mainly correlated with 0.5rho_(sat)~1.5rho_(sat), 2.5rho_(sat)~3.5rho_(sat) and 3.5rho_(sat)~4.5rho_(sat) segments of EOSs; the neutron star radius (R) are mainly correlated with 1.5rho_(sat)~3.5rho_(sat) and the crust segments of EOSs; the moment of inertia (I) are mainly correlated with the density below 4.5rho_(sat) segments of EOSs."

Based on Newtonian hydrodynamics equations, we discuss the effect of three different equations of state (EOSs) (EOS-1 strict; EOS-2 ignoring the degenerate parameter; EOS-3 ignoring the gas pressure) on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of neutrino-driven wind. We find that (1) the EOS ignoring the degenerate parameter is a good approximation; (2) the EOS ignoring the gas pressure causes the density and temperature to decrease, and the speed and entropy per baryon to increase, but the electron fraction is almost not changed. Meanwhile, some important nucleosynthesis parameters, e. g., mass outflow rate and dynamic time scale, are changed dramatically. For a typical 1.4 M_⊙ proto-neutron star model, when the anti-neutrino luminosity is 8*10~(51) erg s~(-1), the wind material is neutron-rich, and the average mass number of the r-element may vary within 6 for different EOSs; While for the anti-neutrino luminosity is 1*10~(51) erg s~(-1), the wind is proton-rich, and the abundance of proton capture element produced by EOSIII is almost one time less than that in the other two EOSs. Therefore an appropriate EOS is very important for final product of nucleosynthesis."

The study of magnetars is an important hotspot in the field of pulsars. In this paper, according to the work of Zhu Cui, et al. (Zhu C, Gao Z F, Li X D, Wang N, Yuan J P, P_eng Q H 2016 Mod. Phys. Lett. A 31 1650070), we reinvestigate the Landau-level stability of electrons in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF), B ? B_(cr)(B_(cr) is a quantum critical magnetic field with a value of 4.414*10~(13) G), and its influence on the pressure of electrons in magnetar. First, we briefly review the pressure of electrons in neutron star (NS) with a weak-magnetic field limit (B ? B_(cr)). Then, we introduce an electron Landau level stability coefficient g_nu and a Dirac-delta function to deduce a modified pressure formula for the degenerate and relativistic electrons in an SMF in an application range of matter density rho ≥ 10~7 g・cm~(-3) and B_(cr)?B < 10~(17) G. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, the SMF can enhance the electron number density n_e, and reduce the maximum of electron Landau level number numax, which results in a redistribution of electrons. As B increases, more and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, and the electron Landau level stability coefficient g_nu will decrease with the augment of Landau energy-level number nu. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, the electron number density n_e increases with the MF strength increasing, leading the electron pressure P_e to increase. Utilizing the modified expression of electron pressure, we discuss the phenomena of Fermion spin polarization and electron magnetization in the SMF, and the modification of the equation of state by the SMF. We calculate the baryon number density, magnetization pressure, and the difference between pressures in the direction parallel to and perpendicular to the magnetic field in the frame of the relativistic mean field model. Moreover, we find that the pressure anisotropy due to the strong magnetic field is very small and can be ignored in the present model. We compare our results with the results from other similar studies, and examine their similarities and dissimilarities. The similarities include 1) the abnormal magnetic moments of electrons and the interaction between them are ignored; 2) the electron pressure relate to magnetic field intensity B, electron number density n_e and electron Fermi energy EeF, and the latter two are complex functions containing B; 3) with n_e and EeF fixed, P_e increases with B rising; 4) as B increases, the pressure-density curves fitted by the results from other similar studies have irregular protrusions or fluctuations, which are caused by the transformation of electron energy state from partial filling to complete filling at the nu-level or the transition of electrons from the nu to the (nu+1)-level. This phenomenon is believed to relate to the behavior of electrons near the Fermi surface in a strong magnetic field, which essentially reflects the Landau level instability. Finally, the future research direction is prospected. The present results provide a reference for future studies of the equation of state and emission mechanism of high-B pulsar, magnetar and strongly magnetized white dwarf."

Its name was coined about 30 years ago. It is successful because the physical laws we discover on Earth should work everywhere. We use laboratory experiments to expand our understanding of physical processes and then apply these results to the processes throughout the Universe. High energy density laboratory astrophysics (HEDLA) allows a depth study and comparison of the measurements produced by laboratory Z-pinches and lasers. In this paper, we review the recent progress in several fields of HEDLA, such as the supernova explosion, stellar jets, photoionized plasmas, stellar opacity and equation of state (EOS) and solar magnetic reconnection. In some cases laboratory experiments can reproduce similar physics. For example, the charged plasmas can be created in the laboratory to study the interactions among photons, electrons and ions that occur in the stars, the solar corona and the X-ray binaries. In other cases, we need some scales to study the processes behind the astrophysical phenomena by the experiments. For example, the evolution of a laboratory plasma jet, with typical spatial scales of a few mm and characteristic timescales of hundreds of ns, can be a scaled version of large-scale jets from young stars (typically thousands of astronomical units in length and evolving in timescales of many years). In order for this scaling to be valid, both the laboratory and astrophysical jets must have similar dimensionless parameters such as the Mach number, Reynolds number, and Peclet number. HEDLA is being paced by large experiments such as NIF, LMJ, and Shenguang lasers. New experimental techniques, improved simulations codes, and experimental diagnostics provide the ground-based testing which benefits our understanding of the Universe. The most powerful laser project is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), in which 196 laser beams deliver nearly 2 megajoules to a millimeter sized target, reproducing the plasma temperatures within stars. The updated experi-mental power makes HEDLA promising to explore more in the Universe and contribute more to the understanding of the astrophysical objects and processes."

This hadron-quark phase transition has important impact on neutron stars, which has received much attention. We consider finite-size effect in this phase transition process, which contains the impact of Coulomb energy and surface energy. By including this effect, the mixed phase forms the pasta structures. The equilibrium conditions for coexisting hadronic and quark phases are derived by minimizing the total energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions. We employ the relativistic mean-field(RMF) model to describe the hadronic phase, while the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(NJL) model is used for the quark phase. We conclude that the finite-size effect will raise the stiffness of EOS, and then increase the maximum mass of neutron stars, which depend on the value of surface tension. Our results show that finite-size effects can significantly reduce the region of the mixed phase, and the results lie between those from the Gibbs and Maxwell constructions. We show that a massive star may contain a mixed phase core and its size depends on the surface tension of the hadron-quark interface."

From neutron drip density to crust-core transition density, the inner crust of neutron star is a nonuniform system where nuclei coexist with nucleon and electron gases surrounding them. As density increases, the nuclear pasta phases with different shapes, such as droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble may appear in the inner crust. Astronomical observations indicate that strong magnetic fields, which may be as high as 10~(18) G, may exist in some neutron stars. So, the crust structure of neutron star may be influenced significantly by the strong magnetic fields. Consequently, a number of astrophysical observations, such as the neutron star oscillations and glitches in the spin rate of pulsars may be affected by the properties of inner crust. In this paper, we adopt the relativistic mean-field theory to describe the nuclear interaction, and anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron are considered as well. In order to study the effects of strong magnetic fields on the properties of nonuniform nuclear matter in inner crust and crust-core transition of neutron stars, we adopt the Wigner-Seitz approximation to describe the nonuniform matter in inner crust, where only one nucleus exists in a Wigner-Seitz cell. Meanwhile, the charge neutrality and fi equilibrium conditions are satisfied. We adopt the self- consistent Thomas-Fermi approximation to obtain the distributions of nucleons and electrons in a Wigner-Seitz cell under strong magnetic fields, and then we calculate the binding energy per nucleon and the properties of Wigner-Seitz cell. It turns out that the properties of inner crust structure and the crust-core transition would not change much with strong magnetic fields B ≤ 10~(17) G comparing with B = 0. The nucleon distribution, binding energy per nucleon, radius of Wigner-Seitz cell, onset density of various nonspherical pasta phases, and crust-core density with B = 10~(17) G are very similar to the corresponding results with B = 0. However, the strong magnetic fields B ≥10~(18) G play an important role in determining the pasta phase structure. As a result, the radius of spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the binding energy per nucleon of various kinds of pasta phases, and the onset densities of nonspherical nuclei and crust-core transition decrease with increasing B, while the area of high density in Wigner-Seitz cell increases. For fixed strength of magnetic fields, as the average baryon density in Wigner-Seitz cell increases, the radius of Wigner-Seitz cell decreases, but the area of high density in the center of the cell increases. The nucleon density at the boundary of Wigner-Seitz cell increases with increasing average baryon density for fixed strength magnetic fields, while the nucleon density at the center area of the cell decreases, which leads to the nucleon distribution in the cell becomes more dispersive."

请用英文重写以下论文摘要：罗西X射线时变探测器(RXTE)在中子星小质量X射线双星中发现了千赫兹准周期振荡现象(kHz QPO)。kHz QP0的频率一般在几百到上千赫兹，其动力学时标与吸积盘最内部区域物质的运动时标一致，因此普遍认为kHz QPO产生于中子星表面附近区域，携带了来自中心中子星及周围强引力场信息，如质量、自转周期、角动量、半径、磁场等。kHz QPO现象的理解为研究强引力场和致密物质状态开启了一扇新的窗口。着重介绍基于kHz QPO的基本现象和相应的理论模型。,"In the power density spectrum of neutron star in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs),the Rossi X-ray Timing Exploer (RXTE)detected kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs).The frequencies of kHz QPOs range from a few hundreds to thousand,which corresponds to the dynamical time-scale for accreting matter in the inner part of the accretion disk.Therefore,it is generally thought to be occurred in the accretion flow close to the neutron star surface,which bringsthe information from the central compact star and its strong gravitational field,such as mass,spinperiod,angular momentum,radius,magnetic field,and so on.So,the kHz QPOs of accreting compact objects open up a new window on the physics of strong gravity and dense matter.Based on the basic phenomena of kHz QPOs,we primarily introduce the theoretical interpretations of kHz QPOs.There are two kinds of models for explain the kHz QPO theoretically.One is involved in the effects ofmagnetosphere,including the beat-frequency explanation and Alfven wave oscillation model.Bothof them consider the interaction between the inner accretion disk and the magnetosphere.But the beat-frequency model predicts a constant frequency interval.With the increasing data,it is foundthat the frequency interval is variable.So this model is inapplicable.The other relates to the effectsof strong field for general relativity,i.e.relativity precession model (RPM)and relativity resonantmodel (RRM).RPM takes the lense-Thirring precession and the classical precession caused by the gravitational quadrupole term due to the compact star rotating.RRM is a pure mathematical model and only can explain the the certain ratio frequency and some frequency relations.There are manyphysical problems which cannot be explained by this model,such as the detailed physics that governs excitation,damping and modulation,the resonance modes and how to excite them,and so on.From the frequency relations among white dwarf,neutron star and black hole and the types of QPOs in these sources,we can infer that both magnetosphere-disk interaction and strong gravity contributeto the emission of kHz QPOs.Analyzing the special properties of the sources,we can study the emission mechanism in detail and promote the theoretical study of kHz QPOs."

They are thought to be the most energetic phenomenon in the universe next to the supernova and the gamma-ray burst. Currently, it is usually thought that the energy driving the GF from the SGR is from the magnetic field in the magnetosphere of the magnetar, the eruption is triggered by the catastrophic loss of equilibrium in the magnetic structure as a result of various instabilities in the structure, and magnetic reconnection subsequently converts most of the magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy of the plasma involved in the eruption. Meanwhile, a small portion of the magnetic energy is used to accelerate charged particles as well. In this review, we introduce the physical properties of magnetars and the observations of GF on SGR. So far, two types of models for GF exist, including the crust model and the magnetosphere model, distinguishing from one another by the region where the energy is stored prior to GF. The former assumes that the energy is stored in the crust of the neutron star, and the latter assumes that thestorage occurs in the magnetosphere. In the crust model,a giantflare is caused by a sudden untwisting of the internal magnetic field and subsequently a large and quick rotational displacement takes place. Alternatively, in the magnetosphere model, the magnetic energy is slowly stored in the magnetosphere until the system reaches a critical state and loses the mechanical equilibrium, triggering the eruption. Observations of the giant flare from SGR 1806-20 on 2004 December 27 showed that it lasted a very short rise time(0.25 ms). This time interval of the eruption is short compared to the timescale required for the crust model and is more consistent with the magnetosphere model. In this paper, some theoretical magnetosphere models are introduced. The magnetohydrodynamical(MHD) model for magnetar giant flares in the framework of the catastrophe model for the coronal mass ejection from the Sun is focused on. In this model, the rotation and/or displacement of the crust causes the field to twist, compress, stretch, and deform, leading to the formation of a magnetic flux rope in the magnetosphere, as well as slow accumulation of the magnetic energy in the related configuration. When the energy and helicity stored in the configuration reach a threshold, the system loses its equilibrium,the flux rope is ejected outward in a catastrophic way, and magnetic reconnection helps the catastrophe develop to a plausible eruption. The calculated light curves of SGR 1806-20,SGR 0526-66, and SGR 1900+14 are in good agreement with the observed light curves of these giant flares. In addition, some MHD simulations about the GF are introduced. Solving the MHD equations for different initial and boundary conditions, the GF can be duplicated in the numerical experiment, the evolution of magnetic configuration, including the current sheet where magnetic reconnection takes place, for the eruption could then be further obtained in detail."

They are believed to be originated from deaths of massive stars (It has been confirmed that some gamma-ray bursts with durations longer than 2 s are confirmed to be associated with a special type of supernovae.) or mergers of two compact stars (e.g. mergers of double neutron stars, which have rather short time scales, and are responsible for short bursts with durations shorter than 2 s). Since the launch and commission of Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, working at 8 keV-300 GeV band, in 2008, significant achievements of gamma-ray bursts prompt emission and high-energy radiation have been made. This review will show some of the important observations of gamma-ray bursts provided by Fermi in recent years, highlighting the implications of these observations to the physics of gamma-ray bursts (including photosphere emission and magnetization of gamma-ray burst ejecta, as well as origins of GeV high-energy emission), especially the major advancements in constraining gamma-ray bursts initial velocity/Lorentz factor, constraining models of extragalactic background light, and testing Lorentz invariance violation provided by high-energy (> 100 MeV) observations made by Fermis LAT instrument."

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：伽玛射线暴(简称伽玛暴或gamma ray burst, GRB)是来自宇宙深处的、短时标的伽玛射线突然增强的现象,是宇宙大爆炸之后最猛烈的爆发现象.伽玛暴可分为长暴(持续时间T90 >2 s)和短暴(T90 < 2 s).观测发现,长暴起源于大质量恒星的塌缩,而短暴起源于双致密星的并合.除了瞬时伽玛辐射,伽玛暴分别在暴后周、月和年时间量级上还会产生X射线、光学和射电余辉.理论上,伽玛暴的瞬时辐射被认为产生于相对论喷流内部的能量耗散过程,而多波段的余辉则产生于相对论喷流与外部介质之间的相互碰撞引起的外激波.因此,伽玛暴是研究致密天体(恒星级质量黑洞和中子星)诞生、引力波辐射、相对论激波、极高能宇宙线、高能中微子等极端物理现象以及高精度检验基本物理原理的天文实验室,也是早期宇宙恒星形成和演化、高红移星系、高红移宇宙学的重要探针.伽玛暴的研究横跨当今天文学、宇宙学、物理学等学科,是当前国际竞争最激烈的自然科学基础研究领域之一. 2017年8月17日, LIGO(laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory)/Virgo引力波天文台和Fermi卫星同时分别探测到引力波事件GW170817和短时标伽玛暴GRB170817A,开辟了多信使天文学的新时代.本文结合相关的关键科学问题评述了伽玛暴和引力波电磁对应体研究领域的最新研究进展,并基于伽玛暴学科领域的发展态势和我国现有的研究基础,讨论如何抓住机遇、布局跨学科的重大研究计划,促进国内与伽玛暴相关科学设备成果的最大化,全面提升我国在这个领域的国际影响力.","Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short-duration flashes of gamma rays occurring at cosmological distances and the most violent explosive phenomena since the cosmic big bang. GRBs were accidentally discovered by Vela military satellites of United States in 1967. The BATSE instrument onboard the Compton Space Gamma-Ray Observatory found two types of GRBs, long-duration (T90 >2s) and short-duration (T90 < 2 s). In 1997, the BeppoSAX satellite for the first time made precise localization of long GRBs, leading to the discoveries of multi-wavelength afterglows, host galaxies and cosmo- logical redshifts of long GRBs. These milestone observations were selected by Science as one of the top ten scientific breakthroughs of the year. In 1999, long GRBs were found to be associated with the birth of stellar mass black holes. In 2003, the HETE-II satellite discovered the first direct association of a long GRB with a type Ic supernova, confirming that long GRBs are linked to the core collapse of massive stars. Science ranked these two major advances as one of the world's top ten scientific breakthroughs of the year in 1999 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the Swift satellite made the first accu- rate localization of short GRBs, leading to the discoveries of afterglows, host galaxies and redshifts of short GRBs. These observations provide indirect evidence that short GRBs originate from mergers of binary systems of compact objects (at least including one neutron star) at cosmological distances. In particular, on 2017 August 17, the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors, for the first time, discovered a GW event from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, GW170817. About 1.74 s after the merger, Fermi/GBM detected a short gamma-ray burst (named GRB170817A). Subsequently, many ground-based and space-based telescopes detected X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, nearly infrared, and radio counterparts to GW170817, especially including a multi-wavelength kilonova (named AT2017gfo). These discoveries mark the beginning of a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. To summarize, all the observations have shown that long bursts originate from the core collapse of massive stars and short bursts originate from the mergers of binary compact objects (at least including one neutron star); besides prompt gamma-ray emission, the sources of GRBs produce X-ray, optical and radio afterglows in timescales of weeks, months and years after the burst trigger, respectively. Theoretically, prompt gamma-ray emissions of GRBs are thought to arise from some energy dissipation processes in the interiors of relativistic jets and multi-wavelength afterglows arise from forward shocks due to collisions between the jets and their ambient media. Therefore, GRBs are not only astronomical laboratories of studying extremely physical phenomena (e.g., newborn compact objects including stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, gravitational waves, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and high-energy neutrinos) and of testing the basic physical principles with high accuracy, but also become an important probe of the star formation and evolution in the early universe, high-redshift galaxies, and cosmology. GRBs now are a multidisciplinary field (in- cluding astronomy, cosmology, and physics) and thus one of the most competitive fundamental research fields. In this paper, we review recent researches of GRBs and electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, by focusing on the relevant key scientific issues, and discuss how to seize the opportunity to plan the interdisciplinary strategy based on the development trend and the research foundation in China, to maximize domestic scientific equipment achievements, and to enhance Chinese international influence in this field."

GRB 060614的L_(iso,on) =(5.12 1.91) * 10~(51) erg ・ s~(-1)与典型短暴相当.这意味着GRB 060614可能属于短暴类型,而GRB 170817A可能本质上就是一个弱暴.","Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A, accompanied by the gravitational wave event GW170817, provides the first direct evidence for a link between a neutron star binary merger and a short duration GRB. GRB 170817A has an extremely weak luminosity, suggesting the jet may be off-axis to the line of sight. The relations between the peak energy E p,i and isotropic luminosity L iso , and between the Lorentz factor Gamma and L iso are used to determine the viewing angle theta'_(obs) and the Lorentz factor Gamma of short GRB 170817A and long short GRB 060614. The results show that, for GR-B 170817A Gamma = 45 27, and theta'_(obs) = 2.2 0.5 ° , for GRB 060614 Gamma = 214 93, and theta'_(obs) = 0.5 0.1 ° .

And the on-axis isotropic luminosity of GRB 060614 is L_(iso,on) = (5.12 1.91) * 10~(51) erg ・ s~(-1) , comparable to the isotropic luminosity of the typical short GRBs.

Theoretically, FRBs may produce optical counterparts with durations from milliseconds to hours. The FRB optical counterparts may be detectable in future large field telescopes in China, including the China Space Station Survey Space Telescope(CSST), the 2.5-meter Large Field Survey Telescope(WFST)of the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC), and the Purple Mountain Observatory(PMO), and Earth 2.0(ET). The fast radio burst optical counterparts are grouped into millisecond time-scale optical counterparts, hourly time-scale optical counterparts, and optical afterglow for our study. The first two can be generated by the high-energy extension of FRBs or the radio radiation of fast radio bursts and the inverse Compton scattering of high-energy electrons. The event rates highly depend on the opticalradio flux ratio eta_v. For millisecond duration optical counterparts, the detection rate of WFST, CSST, and ET can reach hundreds per year in an ideal case. If eta_v ~ 10~(-3), the corresponding annual detection rates of WFST and CSST are in the order of 1, and the annual detection rate of ET is 19.5. For the hourly optical counterparts, ideally, the age of the supernova remnant is 5 years, eta_v is about 10~(-6), and the annual detection rates are above 100. The X-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 indicates that FRBs may produce relativistic outflow, which will interact with the interstellar medium to produce optical afterglows. Combined with the standard afterglow model, the detectability of optical afterglow is explored with a simulation of fast radio bursts following the redshift and energy distribution from the literature.

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：在椭圆轨道的致密双星模型作为周期性重复快速射电暴(Fast Radio Bursts, FRBs)起源的基础上,考虑引力辐射对快速射电暴周期性行为的影响。这个双星系统包含一个具有强偶极磁场的中子星和一个磁化的白矮星。当白矮星充满它的洛希瓣时,物质将通过内拉格朗日点转移到中子星表面。由于角动量守恒,白矮星可能在一次爆发之后被踢开,接着在演化过程中由于引力辐射再次充满洛希瓣,实现再次爆发。这种情况下,快速射电暴的周期对应于双星轨道周期P_(orb),而它与两次质量转移时间间隔Deltat之间的关系是能否显现周期性行为的关键因素。很明显, DeltatP_(orb)或者Deltat < P_(orb)是周期性行为显现的必要条件。反之,如果 Deltat >> P_(orb),周期性将很难观测到。结果表明,只有相对较长周期的快速射电暴才能显示周期性行为,这表明目前仅有的两个周期性快速射电暴都对应于较长的周期是合理的。","Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient and bright radio pulses from cosmological origins, which have two types: repeating FRBs and non-repeating FRBs. Based on the eccentric binary model for the origin of the periodic FRBs, we consider the effects of gravitational-wave (GW) radiation on the periodic activity of repeating FRBs. The compact binary system composed of a neutron star (NS) with a strong bipolar magnetic field and a magnetic white dwarf (WD) may be able to explain the repeated behavior of repeating FRBs. When WD fills its Roche lobe, mass transfer will occur through the inner Lagrange point to the surface of the NS. After an explosion, the WD may be kicked away owing to the conservation of angular momentum, and refills its Roche lobe at the next periastron, due to the decrease of orbital separation through GW radiation to realize another. In this scenario, the period of the repeating FRBs should be equivalent to the orbital period P_(orb). Thus, the relation between P_(orb) and the time interval of two adjacent mass-transfer processes Deltat is a key factor that may determine whether the periodic activity can show up. Obviously, DeltatP_(orb) or Deltat < P_(orb) is a necessary condition for the periodic activity to appear. On the contrary, for Deltat >> P_(orb), the periodicity will be hard to discover. The results show that the periodic activity is more likely to show up for relatively long periods, which may be the reason that only two sources having been claimed to have periodic activity, both correspond to relatively long periods."

The non-detection of neutrinos from GRB 130427A/SN 2013cq can put useful constraint on the models for GRB prompt emission. In this review, we summarize the important observational properties of GRB 130427A/SN 2013cq, which are very valuable for exploring the nature of GRB-SN association and the detailed properties of the prompt and afterglow emission."

In this work, by making use of a conservative symmetry energy slope (SES) range (25 MeV<115 MeV), the constraints from the SES on the structures and properties of static and rapid rotating neutron stars are investigated. The constraint properties include the mass-radius relations, the moments of inertia, the redshift, the deformations of the rapid rotating stars, etc. According to the conservative SES range, it is shown that the radius of a canonical neutron star (with M = 1.4M_⊙) can be constrained in a region of 10.28 s 13.43 km, which is consistent with one of the latest constraints on the radius of neutron star in observations. It is also shown that if a sub-millisecond pulsar with a lighter stellar mass is observed in the future, then a softer SES of the asymmetric nuclear matters is preferred. The universal property of the angular momentum provides a way to obtain the upper limit of the moment of inertia of a rapid rotating neutron star with observed mass. Moreover, the results also can provide a constraint on the lower mass limit (>1.5M_⊙) of pulsar in low-mass X-ray binary EXO0748-676 if the observed redshift of this star is from the polar direction."

Several quark star candidates are suggested,i.e.the accretion-driven millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658,RX J1856-3754 which has quite good featureless black body spectrum, and PSR B0943＋10 which is likely to have small radius.Infrared emission and possible existence of accretion disk around newly-discovered pulsar-like stars are also introduced.Theoretical works including possible formation scenarios of quark stars and the connection to supernova and gamma-ray burst,the glitch phenomenon and star quark model,and quark star surface property are presented.Finally,a short introduction of recent work on quark matter as cosmic rays is given in6."

We investigate the influence of the entropy per baryon for the massive protoneutron star corresponding to PSR J0348+0432. One set of coupling constants GL85 in RMF are selected to reproduce the mass of PSR J0348+0432 at zero temperature, and then extended to describe the massive protoneutron stars with the per baryon entropy S = 1 or S = 2. It is found that the massive protoneutron stars have more hyperons than the cold neutron stars, the temperature increases with the increase of the density from surface to interior, and the existence of hyperons leads to the decrease of the interior temperature. Entropy causes the increase of the mass of massive protoneutron star, and this effect is more obvious than that of the decreasing mass due to hyperons. The entropy per baryon brings on the increase of the radius of protoneutron star. In other words, the protoneutron star's cooling may be a contracting process."

The mean value of the masses of the primaries is higher than that of the companions, which indicates that the primaries may increase their masses by accretion, or the mass of progenitors of the primaries is higher. Therefore, the physical process of supernova explosion through which the high-mass stars become NSs can be investigated. Also it is found that the total masses of the DNSs span a narrow range of 2.5-2.8 M_⊙, implying that the companions might impact on the mass formation of DNSs. Moreover, the mass ratios of the DNSs (primaries to companions) approximate 1 (slightly larger than 1), indicating that the masses of the progenitors of the primaries are approximately equal to the masses of the progenitors of the companions. By analyzing the distribution of the 12 DNSs in the surface magnetic field strength versus spin period (B-P_s) diagram, it is found that the surface magnetic field strength of the primaries of the DNSs is ~ 10~(10) Gs and the spin period is ~ 50 ms; while two pulsars, i.e. PSR J1906+0746 and PSR J0737- 3039B, are located in the region of normal pulsars in the B-P_s diagram, whose surface magnetic field strength is ~ 10~(12) Gs, suggesting that they might not be accelerated through accretion."

It is further proved by our calculation that the EOS around 2 times of the saturation nuclear density has an obvious imprint on the stellar radius of a typical neutron star. In addition, we also investigate the dependence of the mass-radius curve and its slope (dM/dR) on the EOS. It is found that the slope (dM/dR) is mainly determined by the EOS above the saturation nuclear density. In fact, the investigations above will provide some useful theoretical reference. This is expected to conversely constrain the EOS of dense matter by using the future astronomic observation data of neutron star."

VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) observations of Aql X-1 play an essential role in the jet-disk coupling study of NS-LMXBs. They also offer locations of Aql X-1 with sub-mas precision, which can be used in astrometric purpose. Since Aql X-1 exhibits X-ray bursts with evident photospheric radius expansion (PRE burst), the model-independent astrometry (here parallax) can help estimate the luminosity of the PRE bursts, and facilitate the theoretical modeling of PRE bursts. The two reported (in 2009 November and 2013 June) VLBI detections of Aql X-1 reduce the search area of Aql X-1 in other VLBI observations, and effectively lower the S/N threshold of new detections. We devised a procedure to a) determine the search region of the target source with its prior positional information, b) estimate the confidence level of the potential detection using the search region and the statistical information from the relevant VLBI dirty map. This procedure is especially suitable for radio-weak sources with prior positional information. Following this procedure we re-analysed two sets of VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) data obtained in the 2010 January and 2010 July observations, and find two new detections with confidence level of 99.9986% and 99.998 4% respectively. The detections, suitable for astrometric usage, correspond to inconsistent locations showing a displacement towards southwest, which agrees with the previously reported proper motion of Aql X-1. Additionally, the two new radio detections are associated with state transitions of X-ray emission, supporting the widely accepted belief that radio flux of an atoll source is mainly generated at the transitions between hard and soft X-ray state during X-ray outbursts."

In this paper, we summarize these observational progresses until 2012 in the first part. In the second part, we conclude the basic properties of GRBs 130603B and 060614 as well as the theoretical interpretations for their optical - near infrared counterparts whose near infrared excess can be indicative of the signatures of LP-Novae. In the third part, we conclude the basic properties of GRB 080503 and the theoretical interpretations for its optical and X-ray counterparts whose lightcurves can be decomposed into two components originated from afterglow emission and the ejecta heated by a magnetar leaved after double neutron star merger, the latter is nicknamed \Merger-Nova. If the interpretations for the SGRB-associated optical?infrared counterparts are correct, they may provide the first direct evidences showing that short bursts are from compact star mergers and some special long bursts are also from compact star mergers. Besides LP-Novae (and Merger-Novae), the high speed orbital motions of the compact binary just before the merger as well as the merger itself can produce strong Gravitational-Wave Bursts (GWBs). As the era of gravitational wave detection comes soon, the theoretical studies and observational searches of the electromagnetic counterparts of neutron star - neutron star or neutron star- black hole mergers have received more attentions. Since the gravitational wave positioning has larger uncertainty, observation of the associated LP-Novae can be the best way to precisely locate the GWB.

On the other hand,local density fluctuations in the early Universe could also form primordial black holes of stellar mass. Since the dawn of the Universe,stellar-mass black holes(SBHs)can come together to form binaries through mechanisms such as coevolution and dynamical processes. Before ground-based gravitational wave(GW)detectors made their first successful detections,the masses of SBHs had been measured by electromagnetic waves only,and never exceeded around 15 solar masses. The LIGO/Virgo detection of GWs from binary SBH mergers has drawn the attention of many scientists,in particular,the GW signals resulting from the inspirals of binary SBHs should be detectable by space-borne GW detectors. Based on the number of GW events detected by groundbased detectors,it is expected that TianQin will be able to detect a few to dozens of GW events related to inspirals of binary SBHs. Given the long expected duration for each inspiral event,such signals can help measure parameters including the expected merger time(down to ~1 second)and the exact location of the SBH(down to 1 square degree). The inspiral through merging of binary SBHs will provide excellent astrophysical probes for multi-frequency GW observations."

The frequency of X-ray burst oscillation is close to the neutron star spin rate. In recent years, about 30 neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries have been detected X-ray burst oscillations from RXTE, Swift and NICER observations. They are important to probe the dense matter equation of state and the effects of strong gravity, to study the high magnetic field environment on the neutron star surface. The studies of X-ray burst oscillations are also crucial to understand the spinup process of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries through accretion and the evolution into millisecond pulsars. The different characteristics of burst oscillation signals between persistent accretion-powered pulsars, intermittent accretion-powered pulsars and sources without detectable accretion-powered pulsations can help us to study more about it. We briefly introduce type I X-ray bursts, and then specifically explain the methods to search for burst oscillations and provide the observational results of X-ray burst oscillations. The theoretical burst oscillation model, i.e., the hot spot model, the surface mode model and the cooling wake model, are discussed. At present, we note that these models are difficult to explain all the observed phenomena of X-ray burst oscillations. In future, the China-led mission, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) observatory will observe neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries and search X-ray burst oscillations. By modeling the stacking pulse profile of X-ray burst oscillation, the mass and radius of neutron star will be measured accurately, and the neutron star equation of state will be tightly constrained.

Since the neutron fraction is very large, nuclear symmetry energy may have an important impact on the properties of nonuniform matter. However, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy around saturation density is still rather uncertain. This paper focuses on the influence of nuclear symmetry energy on the density range of inner crust, pasta phase structure, and crust-core transition density of neutron star, where the relativistic mean field theory is adopted to describe the nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is turned out that the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence play an import role in determining the properties of nonuniform matter in the inner crust of neutron star, which is consistent with the former related studies.","中子星内壳层中存在原子核、中子、电子等非均匀分布的物质。在Wigner-Seitz近似下,共存相方法和自洽Thomas-Fermi近似方法是描述这种非均匀物质的有效方法。中子在非均匀物质所占的比例远远大于其他组分,因此原子核的对称能对非均匀物质的性质会产生十分重要的影响,而原子核对称能的密度依赖关系在核物质饱和密度附近有较大的不确定性。采用相对论平均场理论描述核子间相互作用,研究原子核对称能对中子星内壳层的密度范围、pasta相结构、壳核相变密度等性质的影响,探寻其中可能存在的关联。计算结果表明,原子核对称能及其密度依赖性在决定中子星内壳层非均匀物质的性质中起着重要作用,这与之前相关研究中得到的结论基本相符。"

The cyclotron resonant scattering feature ( CRSF) at energies from 35-47 keV was detected in the hard X-ray spectra,suggesting the magnetic field of 5*10~(12) Gs. The variations of the CRSF show no relation to the X-ray luminosity while the line centroid energy of the CRSF has a positive correlation to the photon index and spectral cutoff energy,and there also exists a weak correlation between the absorption depth and cutoff energy. These relations support the idea that the spectral cutoff in accreting X-ray pulsars is strongly affected by the cyclotron resonant scattering. The correlation between the ratio of the line width to the centroid energy and absorption depth implies a tall cylindrical accreting column on the surface of the neutron star in GX 301-2. The explanation of the long spin period in GX 301-2 requires a strong surface magnetic field at least higher than 2*10~(14) Gs which is contradict with the measured value based on the cyclotron line energy. The line-forming region with a height at least larger than two neutron star radii is proposed to resolve the contradiction. This scenario is supported by the tall cylindrical accreting column on the neutron star surface in GX 301-2 according to the variation patterns of the CRSF.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：We investigate the measurement of neutron star masses in different population of binaries. Based on the collection of the orbital parameters of 40 systems (46 sources), we apply the boot-strap method together with the Monte Carlo method to reconstruct the likelihood curves for each source separately. The cumulative analysis of the simulation result shows that the neutron star masses in X-ray systems and radio systems obey different distributions, and no evidence for the bimodal distribution could be found. Employing the Bayesian statistical techniques, we find that the most likely distributions for the high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), double neutron star (DNS) systems, and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) binary systems are (1.3400.230) M_⊙,(1.5050.125) M_⊙, (1.3350.055) M_⊙, and (1.4950.225) M_⊙, respectively. The statistical distribution has no significant deviation from the standard neutron star formation mechanism. It is noticed that the statistical results of the center masses of LMXBs and NS-WD systems are significantly higher than the other groups by about 0.16 M_⊙, which could be regarded as the evidence of accretion episodes. And if we regard the HMXBs and LMXBs as the progenitors of DNS and NS-WD systems, then we can draw the conclusion that the accretion effect must be very week during the evolution trajectory from HMXBs to DNS systems, and this could be the reason why the masses of DNS systems have such a narrow distribution.","通过调研高质量X射线源(HMXB)、低质量X射线源(LMXB)、双中子星(DNS)系统、中子星-白矮星(NS-WD)双星系统这4类不同系统中中子星质量的测量方法,收集了40套系统的轨道参数,利用boot-strap方法和蒙特卡罗方法,重建了46颗中子星测量质量的似然概率曲线。基于模拟结果的统计分析,表明X射线中子星系统和射电脉冲星系统的中子星质量遵循不同的分布。另外,Bayesian统计针对这4类不同的系统分别给出的最可几的概率密度分布分别为:(1.3400.230) M_⊙,(1.5050.125) M_⊙, (1.3350.055) M_⊙和(1.495士0.225) M_⊙。值得注意的是高质量X射线源和双中子星系统的中子星质量都比另外两组系统要小大约0.16 M_⊙,这个结果与脉冲星通过吸积大约0.2 Me物质加速到毫秒量级的理论模型相一致.如果将高质量X射线源和低质量X射线源分别看作是双中子星系统和脉冲星-白矮星系统的前身系统,那么吸积效应对高质量X射线源的中子星质量的影响势必非常小,其质量分布应该非常接近中子星形成时的初始质量分布,而低质量X射线源和脉冲星-白矮星系统则应已经过充分的吸积过程,从而与初始质量分布产生了较大的偏移。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Understanding the phase structures of strong interaction matter is an active frontier in nuclear physics research currently, and it will provide crucial insights into heavy-ion collision experiments as well as neutron star observations. Most studies in this area focus on the influence of extremely high temperatures and baryon densities on matter properties, especially pertaining to phase transitions such as the chiral symmetry breaking and color superconductivity. Recent experimental and theoretical studies reported that in non-central heavy-ion collisions, systems carry a large initial angular momentum that becomes very strong vorticity fields in the bulk fluid. This has thus introduced several new questions regarding the properties of strong interaction matter under vorticity fields, and have led to many novel results. Thermal field theory calculations based on rotating frame and mean-field approximation have been developed to study various phase transitions under rotation, such as chiral symmetry breaking, color superconductivity and superfluidity at high isospin asymmetry. The results have demonstrated important impacts of vorticity fields on the phase boundaries of these transitions, and have also revealed nontrivial new phase structures of strong interaction matter under rotation. A new dimension of the usual QCD phase diagram has been unveiled. The study of rotation-induced phase transition extends phase transition research to a broader space.

This paper establishes the importance of radio telescopes via examples of the discovery of gravitational waves, the merger of neutron stars, and the first black hole photograph.

To this end, this paper describes the development of radio telescopes built and put into operation in the last decade, as well as those under construction and to be built, and emphasizes the importance of coupled structural-electromagnetic theory in the design, manufacture, and operation of radio telescopes. Then, the paper systematically summarizes the application of coupled structural-electromagnetic theory in radio telescopes.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The searching for potential quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition signals is a fundamental goal of on-going experiments on heavy-ion collisions, which is critical to understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, the inner structure of compact stars, gravitational waves emitted from neutron star mergers, etc. In particular, the beam energy scan program carried out at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) provides a unique tool that enables studies into the QCD phase diagram and the conjectured QCD critical point. Besides the event-by-event fluctuation of conserved charges, which has been widely accepted as a useful study of the QCD critical point, the production of light nuclei can serve as a sensitive observable to the QCD phase transitions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The density fluctuation and correlation among nucleons are automatically encoded in the production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions. This study aims to demonstrate how to probe QCD phase transition with light nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions. The progress of studies in this area over the last few years is reviewed. The nucleon coalescence model provides a suitable tool for the study of the effects of density fluctuation/correlation on light nuclei production. A transport model based on the Nambu-Jona- Lasinio (NJL) model is developed to simulate the occurrence of the first-order chiral phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model for light nuclei production, the yield ratio N_tN_p/N_d~2 of protons (p), deuterons (d), and tritons (t) is shown to be sensitive to the nucleon density fluctuation and correlation and can function as a good probe to the non-smooth QCD phase transition. The production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions encodes the information about baryon density fluctuations and correlations, and enhancements of the yield ratio N_tN_p/N_d~2 could serve as an indicator for the occurrence of a first-order or second-order QCD phase transition.","寻找量子色动力学(Quantum Chromodynamics,QCD)相变信号是当前重离子碰撞实验的一个基础科学目标,对理解强相互作用物质的性质、大爆炸初期的宇宙演化、超新星的爆发机制、致密星的内部结构以及双中子星并合产生的引力波等重要前沿问题都具有重要意义。当重离子碰撞中发生非连续QCD相变时,引发的强相互作用物质的密度涨落与关联可以通过轻原子核的产额观察量来探测。核子间的多体关联决定了重离子碰撞中轻核的产额。特别地,基于核子并合模型对于轻核产额的计算表明质子(p)、氘核(d)和氚核(t)的产额比值N_tN_p/N_d~2敏感于核子密度涨落与关联,是一个较好的寻找QCD相变信号的可观测量。进一步,基于输运模型对于重离子碰撞中的手征相变的模拟发现,当系统的相轨迹经过一阶相变区域时,轻核产额比值N_tN_p/N_d~2有明显增加。这些结果为利用重离子碰撞中的轻核产生寻找QCD相变提供了理论依据。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The resonant inverse Compton scattering(RICS) of relativistic electrons in an intense magnetic field of a neutron star is an efficient mechanism for producing the high-energygamma-rays due to its high efficiency, high frequency, highly beaming behaviour and comparatively good monochromaticity, concentrating most radiation in the high-frequency band(hard X-ray andgamma-ray).In our previous work,it is argued that the dominant radiation mechanism responsible for the promptgamma-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts(GRBs) in the early stage could be the RICS of relativistic electrons. By using this mechanism, some puzzles in the study of GRBs could be clarified,e.g., the origin of the Amati relation, the formation of the observed broken power-law spectra, the related deadline problem, the polarization property, etc. The simplified analytical formulae of collective RICS spectra of the assembly of relativistic electrons in an intense magnetic field are derived in this paper, based on the simple RICS power spectra of a single fast electron given in our previous work. By using these formulae,a series of collective RICS spectra for various typical ambient low-frequency radiation fields around the central neutron star,e.g., the black body radiation, the nonthermal field with a power-law spectrum and the thermal bremsstrahlung field, are calculated. The collective RICS spectra are all in quite simple analytical expressions, which are convenient for comparison with the observed spectra. Our calculations show that the RICS process is really a very efficient radiation mechanism in the hard X-ray andgamma-ray bands if theaccommodation condition(or thematching condition) is satisfied.

For the purpose of the practical applications of the RICS process, in this paper, we present a basic formula of the collective RICS spectrum for an assembly of relativistic electrons moving along the direction of near-magnetic axis of a strongly magnetized neutron star or strange star. The derivation of the formula is based on the simple RICS emission spectrum of a single fast electron given in our previous paper (you et al. 2003). By using this basic formula, we calculate a series of collective RICS spectra for various typical ambient low-frequency radiation fields around the central neutron star, e.g. the bremsstrahlung, the black body radiation, and the nonthermal field with power law form spectrum, etc. We thus obtain the collective RICS spectra in quite simple analytical expressions, which is in favor of the comparison with the observed spectra. Our results show that the RICS process is a very efficient radiation mechanism if the 'accommodation condition' is satisfied. We show that various RICS spectra have a common broken power-law form (different power-laws in two sections), despite of the form of the ambient low-frequency field.

In this work, We analyze the influence of delta mesons on the equation of states, the maximum mass, the tidal Love numbers and the tidal deformabilities for the conventional neutron stars and the hyperon stars within the relativistic mean field theory. It is found that the presence of delta mesons can strengthen the tidal deformabilities of the low and medium-mass conventional neutron stars (or hyperon stars). However, the strengthening trends of the tidal deformabilities with delta mesons gradually weaken with the increase of the mass of the conventional neutron stars (or hyperon stars). Especially for massive hyperon stars, the tidal deformabilities of the superstars with delta mesons is weaker than the corresponding values without delta mesons. Moreover, the presence of hyperons can reduce the tidal deformabilities of stars with the same mass. For the stars containing delta mesons, only the tidal deformabilities in the hyperon stars with Lambda, Sigma and Xi hyperons can satisfy the constraints of GW170817 and GW190814 events under the parameters selected in the paper.

In this article, we introduce the basic characters of gravitational wave in Einstein's general relativity, their observational effects and main generation mechanisms, including the rotation of neutron stars, the evolution of binary systems, the spontaneous generation in the inflation universe. Different sources produce the gravitational waves at quite different frequencies, which can be detected by different methods. In the lowest frequency range (f < 10~(-15) Hz), the detection is mainly dependent of the observation of B-mode polarization of cosmic microwave background radiation. In the middle frequency range (10~(-9) < f < 10~(-6) Hz), one detects gravitational waves by analyzing the timing residuals of millisecond second pulsars. In the high frequency range (10~(-4) < f < 10~4 Hz), it can be detected by space-based and ground-based laser interferometers. In particular, we focus on the main features, detection methods, detection status and the future prospects for several important sources, including the continuous sources (e.g. spinning neutron stars, stable binary systems), the burst sources (e.g. supernovae, the mergence of binary system), and the stochastic backgrounds generated by the astrophysical and cosmological process.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The radiation theory of pulsar suggests that when the induced electric field and voltage caused by the rotated magnetic field of the neutron star decrease, which can not produce enough electron and positron pairs, the radio radiation of the pulsar will disappear, i.e., die. This paper analyzes the space distributions and the physical properties such as the spin periods of the 34 sources under the death line, i.e., the radio pulsars with a low spin-down energy loss rate. Firstly, these pulsars are all in the galactic field, which show no obvious correlation with the special types of pulsars and the pulsars with a high-energy radiation; Secondly, these pulsars locate in the low galactic latitude and near the solar system; Thirdly, these pulsars show the relative larger characteristic ages and larger spin periods; Last, the radio luminosity of 1400 MHz and the spin-down power E of these pulsars show a weak correlation. We argue that the radio pulsars with a low spin-down power may loss energy due to radiation, causing the deceleration of the spin, whose E decreases below the death line. We suggest that the survey for the radio pulsars with a low spin-down power should focus on the old and long spin period radio sources in the galactic field, and it is unnecessary to focus on the special type of the pulsars or the certain spatial positions.

Firstly, we find that the CCOs share the similar average spin period to the normal supernova remnant (SNR) pulsars, however, the average surface magnetic field strength of CCOs (B ~ 5.4*10~(10) Gs) is lower than the normal SNR pulsars (B ~ 7.7*10~(12) Gs) by ~ 2 orders of magnitudes. Meantime, we also find that almost all the normal SNR pulsars lie in the position above the spin-up line, while all the CCOs lie in the position under the spin-up line. Therefore, we doubt that CCOs may origin from the accretion induced spin-up process in the binaries. Secondly, we analyze the possible binary evolution process of CCOs based on recycling theory of the neutron stars: in the binary, a CCO can accrete the ?M ~ 10 - 2 M_⊙ matter with the accretion rate of M ~ 10~(17) g・s~(-1) during the time of ~ 10~6 yrs, then its spin period will decrease from P ~ 10 s to P ~ 0.1 s, and its surface magnetic field strength will decrease from B ~ 10~(12) Gs to B ~ 10~(10) Gs. Considering that the evolution timescale of ~ 10~6 yr is far longer than the age of the SNRs containing CCOs (~ 0.3-7 kyr), we suppose that CCOs may be the products of the supernova of the first star in the binary, and the binary is disintegrated during the supernova of the second star, which leaves a CCO and the SNR of the second star. This model predicts that there may exit a young normal pulsar near the CCO (P ~ 0.02 s, B ~ 10~(12) Gs), and we expect that the radio telescope and high energy detector can survey these sources in the future.","探讨了认为中心致密天体(CCO)起源于双星的可能性.首先, CCO与正常遗迹脉冲星有着相似的平均自旋周期,但CCO的平均表面磁场强度(B ~ 5.4*10~(10) Gs)低于正常遗迹脉冲星(B ~ 7.7*10~(12) Gs) ~ 2个量级.同时,几乎所有的正常遗迹脉冲星均分布在爱丁顿吸积加速线以上,而CCO全部分布在自旋加速线以下.因此怀疑CCO可能起源于双星吸积加速过程.其次,基于中子星再加速理论,分析了CCO可能的双星演化过程:双星系统中, CCO以M ~ 10~(17) g・s~(-1)的吸积率,经过~ 10~6 yr的时间共吸积?M ~ 10~(-2) M_⊙的物质,其自旋周期将会从P ~ 10 s降低至P ~ 0.1 s,表面磁场强度将会从B ~ 10~(12) Gs降低至B ~ 10~(10) Gs.考虑到~ 10~6 yr的演化时标远大于CCO遗迹的年龄(~ 0.3-7 kyr),猜想CCO可能是双星系统中第1颗恒星超新星爆发的产物,而第2颗恒星超新星爆发后双星解体,留下CCO和第2颗恒星的超新星遗迹.该模型预言在CCO附近可能存在一颗年轻的正常脉冲星(P ~ 0.02 s, B ~ 10~(12) Gs),并期望未来的射电望远镜和高能探测器能够进行搜寻."

Our results indicate that, both in the strong and weak interacting case, the equation of state for hybrid star matter contain dark matter become softer than that of without dark matter while the mass of dark matter particles larger than 0.5 GeV, which leads to the decrease of the mass and corresponding radius of hybrid star.

Around saturation density, both the value and the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy have been roughly constrained, its high-density behavior is now still in argument. Probing high-density symmetry energy at terrestrial laboratories is being carried out at facilities that offer radioactive beams worldwide. While relevant experiments are being conducted, we theoretically developed more advanced isospin-dependent transport model including new physics such as nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations and in-medium isospin-dependent baryon-baryon scattering cross section. New sensitive probes of the high-density symmetry energy are provided, such as squeezed-out neutron to proton ratio, photon and light cluster as well as the production of mesons with strangeness or hidden strangeness. The blind spots of probing the high-density symmetry energy by sensitive observable are demonstrated. Model dependences of frequently used sensitive probes of the symmetry energy have been studied thoroughly based on different transport models. A qualitative observable of neutron to proton ratio at high kinetic energy is proposed to probe the high-density symmetry energy qualitatively. The probed density regions of the symmetry energy by some observables are first studied and usually lower probed density regions comparing with maximum compression density are obtained. Nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations usually reduce values of sensitive observables of the symmetry energy. Probing the curvature of the symmetry energy by involving the slope information of the symmetry energy at saturation point in the transport model is proposed.

In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the relativistic mean-field(RMF) model. Some popular non-linear and density-dependent RMF parametrizations will be adopted to investigate the role of hyperons in a hyperonic star on its mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties. Finally, the coupling strengths between mesons and hyperons are also discussed, which can generate the massive hyperonic star with present RMF parameter sets, when the vector coupling constants are strong.","随着引力波探测以及对中子星质量与半径的高精度测量,中子星作为超新星爆发的剩余产物正吸引着相关领域的高度关注。在中子星的内核部分,诸如超子之类的奇异自由度有可能会出现从而形成超子星。本工作在相对论平均场模型框架下研究由核子与轻子构成的中子星以及包含超子的超子星。采用目前常用的非线性相对论平均场以及密度依赖的相对论平均场参数研究了超子对超子星质量、半径、潮汐形变等性质的影响。最后讨论了介子与超子的耦合常数对超子星性质的影响,发现当矢量介子与超子耦合系数较强时,利用现有的相对论平均场模型参数可以获得大质量的超子星。"

We use the method of Monte-Carlo random sampling to deal with the uncertainty of measured masses to increase the accuracies of statistical results. We find that the measured masses have a bimodal distribution, with the first peak around (1.3280.220) M_⊙, and a much wider second peak at (1.7730.416) M_⊙,respectively. It is worth noting that, even though the DNSs are excluded, the mass distribution is still bimodal and peaked respectively at (1.3600.337) M_⊙ and (1.8540.322) M_⊙. The average mass of 18 DNSs is(1.3300.0089) M_⊙. Through the above mass distribution, it can be clearly seen that DNS has a little influence on the mass distribution of NS, and the distribution of NS mass also implies that there are two birth modes of NSs. We think that they are the nuclear collapse supernova explosion and the electron capture supernova eruption. The single peak structure of DNS mass implies that the evolution mechanism of DNS may be different from other binary systems. In order to further study the characteristics of neutron star mass distribution, we divide the 53 NSs with measured mass into two groups, the millisecond neutron star (MSP, the spin period P_s ≤ 20 ms) and normal neutron star (PSR, Ps > 20 ms). We find that their mass distributions also show the bimodal structure, and the average mass of MSP is ~0.22 M_⊙ larger than the average mass of PSR. This indicates that the spin of NS will reach milliseconds after the accretion of about 0.22 M_⊙.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The equation of state(EoS)of neutron star matter plays a key role in both the structure and evolution of a neutron star.However,as lattice QCD faces significant difficulties in simulating dense matter,only effective models can be relied on to unveil their properties,such as the microscopic many body theories and density functional theories. Due to the uncertainties reside in model assumptions and parameters,the matter state and composition of dense matter are still unclear and exhibit large ambiguities, leading to large uncertainties in the corresponding EoSs.The measurements of neutron star properties in multi-messenger era,on the other hand,have placed a stringent constraint on its EoS.For example,the measurements of 2 M_⊙ pulsars have ruled out various soft EOSs for dense stellar matter.Based on the multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817,the tidal deformability of 1.4 M_⊙ neutron star is believed to lie within 70≤Lambda1.4≤580with the corresponding radii R=(11.91.4)km,excluding the EoSs which are too stiff at small densities.The masses and radii of the two millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451and PSR J0740+6620 were measured accurately via pulse-profile modeling with NICER and XMM-Newton data,where similar radii(about 12.4km)were obtained despite their large differences in masses.This reduces the likelihood of a strong first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with masses M≤2 M_⊙.Adopting various EoS parameterizations which are either phenomenological or nuclear physics-motivated,extensive investigations were carried out by applying those observational data to constraining the EoSs and neutron star properties with Bayesian parameter estimation.On the other hand,as proposed by Biswas,one can take a complementary approach to estimate statistically the most preferred EoS according to the current observations.In light of the recently obtained 10 unified neutron star EoSs using relativistic mean field models with nonlinear self couplings(NL3,PK1,TM1,GM1,and MTVTC)and density-dependent couplings (DD-LZ1,DDME-X,PKDD,DD-ME2,and TW99),combined with the other 6unified EoSs(FSU2,DD2,NL3wr-L55,FSU2R,FSU2H,and TM1e)which were obtained in a similar manner,those EoS models then can be studied for Bayesian model selection, which is not included in Biswass original study.In this work,a Bayesian model selection on the 16unified neutron star EoSs predicted by relativistic mean field models is thus performed,which are available on CompOSE.In particular,the tidal deformability measurements were used from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817and the simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451and PSR J0740+6620by the NICER collaboration.The most preferred EoS model is DD2,which predicts the radius and tidal deformability of a 1.4 M_⊙neutron star to be 13.19km and 687,respectively. The selected EoS models that are not ruled out by observation can then be ordered with respect to the relative odds ratio:DD2,TW99,DD-LZ1,DD-ME2, TM1e,FSU2H,DDME-X,PKDD,FSU2R,and MTVTC.These EoSs predict that the radii and tidal deform abilities of 1.4 M_⊙ neutron stars should lie within 12.3-13.6km and 400-784,while the maximum masses range from 2.02 M_⊙to 2.56 M_⊙.","当前中子星的观测为其状态方程提供了严格的约束条件。基于双中子星并合事件GW170817对潮汐形变的约束,以及NICER合作组对PSR J0030+0451和PSR J0740+6620的质量和半径的测量,本文对CompOSE数据库中基于相对论平均场模型统一得到的16组中子星状态方程开展了贝叶斯模型选择。发现最理想的物态模型是DD2,它预测1.4倍太阳质量中子星的半径为13.19km,潮汐形变为687。在此基础之上,进一步筛选出最符合观测的物态模型依次为DD2、TW99、DD-LZ1、DD-ME2、 TM1e、FSU2H、DDME-X、PKDD、FSU2R和MTVTC。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The detection of deep space pulsars is a key factor that constrains the equation of states and the theoretical models of neutron stars. In particular, the process of observing the peculiar pulsars and their systems, such as sub-millisecond pulsars, binary neutron star systems, neutron star-black hole systems, etc., has played a very important role in understanding the evolution of stars and the true internal structure of neutron stars. For example, the extremely high rotation frequencies of sub-millisecond pulsars may play a key role in constraining the equation of state of neutron stars and verifying the evolution of structure and mechanism in the rapidly rotating neutron stars. The researches of the macroscopic properties of sub-millisecond pulsars can provide important clues to whether quark matter can appear in sub-millisecond pulsars, and whether there is an association between the mass range of sub-millisecond pulsars and the possible mass gaps of neutron stars and black holes. The discovery of peculiar pulsars and their systems can promote astronomical observations to find the effective ways to distinguish neutron stars from quark stars.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The author demonstrates that how to understand the Glitches of solid pulsars in the starquake model. Glitch is the sudden spin-up during the normal spin-down process,which has been observed in many pulsars. The mechanism of Glitches is still a matter of debate because it depends on the unsolved problem that what is the nature of pulsars. One of the models of pulsars,the so-called solid quark-cluster stars,could not be ruled out by neither the astrophysics observations nor theoretical considerations. The Glitches of solid quarkcluster stars could naturally be the result of starqukes. During the spinning-down of the solid star,the strain energy develops until the stress reaches the critical value,then some parts of the star fragment,which would suddenly decrease the moment of inertia of the star,leading to the sudden increase of the rotation frequency that manifests as a Glitch. If the star has high mass or rotates slowly,the shrink of radius would happen during the starquake,leading to a huge amount of energy releasing which accounts for AXPs/SGRs. On the other hand,if the star rotates fast,only the oblateness of the star changes during the starquake,which would lead to negligible releasing of energy. This paper discusses the phenomenon of Glitches for solid quark-cluster stars,including the physical processes and consequences of starquakes,as well as the reasons for different energy releasing during Glitches. Further theoretical study combined with more observations about Glitches would be helpful for us to test the conjecture of sold quark-clusters.","Glitch指脉冲星发生的自转角速度突然增大的现象,在许多脉冲星中都探测到了。Glitch的产生机制与脉冲星内部结构相关,而后者依然是待解决的难题。天文观测和理论研究均不能排除一类可能性,即脉冲星类天体本质上是固态夸克集团星,而固态星体发生Glitch的最自然的解释就是星震。本工作在星震模型下研究了固态脉冲星的Glitch现象。固态星体在自转减慢过程中,会发生应力能(或弹性能)的积累,当积累的应力超过星体能承受的限度,星体会发生碎裂,即发生星震,此时由于转动惯量突然减小而导致自转角速度突然增大,表现为Glitch现象。根据此模型可得到Glitch的幅度与时间间隔的关系。如果星体的质量较大而自转较慢,星震过程可能同时伴随体积的减小,即体积改变的星震,此时通常会有显著的引力能释放,可以解释观测到的反称X射线脉冲星/软伽马射线重复暴(AXPs/SGRs);如果星体转速较快,星震过程可能只表现为形状即扁率的微小变化,此时不会有显著的能量释放。这两类Glitches可以解释观测现象。进一步的理论研究结合更多观测,有望使人们利用Glitch现象来检验固态夸克集团星这一理论猜想。"

Since there is a quadrupole deformation of the mass distribution of pulsars, the gravitational wave radiation will reduce the rotational speed of the pulsar.

In this work, based on the measured binary parameters of PSR J1906+0746, the relation between surface magnetic field strength and spin period of binary radio pulsar is studied. This makes us understand a rough evolutionary path of PSR J1906+0746. Then, we assumed a nonrecycle companion formed by electron capture according to the formation mechanism of DNS and the loss of matter during the formation of binary stars. Further calculation shows that the progenitor mass of the companion is about 1.57 M⊙, and it has lost 0.23 M⊙ during the formation of the DNS system. This may be caused by that the electron capture energy is so low that it can not compete with the gravitational binding energy of the progenitor, and eventually the ejecta is bound to form a ring. The ring surrounding the PSR J1906+0746 observed in the X-ray band is explained successfully.","PSR J1906+0746是2006年发现的一颗自旋周期为144 ms的射电脉冲星,由于探测到的是第2颗形成的非自转加速伴星,主星和伴星组成的系统极有可能成为另一对双脉冲星.从PSR J1906+0746的基本物理量出发,针对性地对比研究双中子星和脉冲双星(包括中子星-白矮星)的磁场-周期关系,大致得出他们的演化路径;其次通过双中子星的形成机制以及双星形成过程中的物质损失,假定非自转加速的伴星形成于电子俘获,得出伴星前身星的质量约为1.57 M⊙,在形成双中子星系统过程中损失了约0.23 M⊙. 这可能是由于电子俘获能量较低,不能抗衡伴星的引力束缚能,最终抛出物质没有逃逸,形成了一个椭圆环,成功解释了在X射线波段观测到的围绕着PSR J1906+0746的环结构."

Those nuclei in the daily life are forbidden to fuse by compression due to the Coulomb repulse, nevertheless, it is usually unexpected in extraterrestrial extreme-environments: the gravity in a core of massive evolved star is so strong that all the other forces (including the Coulomb one) could be neglected. Compressed baryonic matter is then produced after supernova, manifesting itself as pulsar-like stars observed. The study of this compressed baryonic matter can not only be meaningful in fundamental physics (e.g., the elementary color interaction at low-energy scale, testing gravity theories, detecting nano-Hertz background gravitational waves), but has also profound implications in engineering applications (including time standard and navigation), and additionally, is focused by Chinese advanced telescopes, either terrestrial or in space. Historically, in 1930s, L. Landau speculated that dense matter at supra-nuclear density in stellar cores could be considered as gigantic nuclei (the prototype of standard model of neutron star), however, we address that the residual compact object of supernova could be of condensed matter of quark clusters.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：One of the most remarkable features of pulsars is their rotational stability. Through measuring the times of arrival of pulsars, a surprisingly large amount of information can be obtained, such as, providing precise information on rotational slowdown of pulsars, testing the general relativity and gravitational waves, detecting exoplanets, determining fundamental parameters of binary systems, and also providing time standard with stabilities comparable to that of the best atomic clocks. The angular momentum of an isolated pulsar only changes through the braking torque of the magnetic dipole radiation; therefore, the effect on the pulse times of arrival would be usually predictable and smooth. However, two interesting irregularities in pulsar rotation have been observed. The first kind is `glitches' which sudden increases in their rotation rates followed by a period of relaxation. Glitches occur more frequently in younger pulsars, but have also been observed in millisecond pulsars. The other behavior is known as `timing noise', which is a continuous but erratic behaviour relative to a simple slow down model and consists of low-frequency structures. The pulsars have large period derivatives generally show more prominent timing noise. A more complete understanding of pulsar timing noise will provide us an insight into the interior structure of neutron stars. In this paper, the pulsar spin-down model is reviewed and analyzed. An overview of observational progress of timing noise of pulsars in recent years is provided, in light that many observatories worldwide have been developed and operated. On the basis of existing observation data, some problems of classification of timing noise and observational braking index, which can not be explained by the simple spin-down model, are discussed in detail. Moreover, many models for timing noise are introduced, including physical and phenomenological models. In the last, further developments and prospects in this area are also outlooked.","脉冲星自转的稳定性是其最显著的特征之一,利用这种特征可以提供脉冲星自身自转减慢的精确信息,研究强引力场中的广义相对论效应,检验引力波,探测太阳系外行星,以及提供计时标准。然而,在脉冲星自转的长期观测中,两种有趣的不规则性被观测到,这其中把广泛存在于脉冲星中且最为普遍的现象称为计时噪声,多表现为相当连续且不稳定的行为,并且多由低频结构组成。对于具有较大周期导数的脉冲星而言,通常会具有更加明显的计时噪声。全面地研究计时噪声有助于深入了解中子星的内部结构。在回顾分析脉冲星自转减慢模型的基础上,对近年来脉冲星计时噪声的观测进展进行了概述。针对现有的观测数据,讨论了目前关于计时噪声分类以及观测制动指数中存在的问题。另外,介绍和评述了脉冲星计时噪声的相关理论模型。最后,展望了未来观测方面的发展方向和前景。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Nuclear symmetry energy plays an important role in the properties of nuclei and neutron stars. Since theoretical predictions of the density dependence of symmetry energy S(p) from microscopic nucleon- nucleon interactions show large uncertainties, especially in the region of suprasaturation density, constraining the density dependence of symmetry energy has become one of the main goals in nuclear physics and has stimulated many theoretical and experimental studies. In this paper, we have reviewed the ImQMD05 code and its description on charge distribution, collective flow and nuclear-nuclear stopping. By comparing ImQMD05 prediction with data, the isoscalar part of nucleonic mean field, the energy and density dependence of inmedium NN cross sectoin in the ImQMD05 were determined. In order to extracting the symmetry energy information by comparing the ImQMD05 calculations with the data for ~(112, 124) Sn+~(112, 124) Sn at E_(beam) = 50 MeV/u, the influence of symmetry potential and in-medium NN cross section on the isospin sensitive observables of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions was investigated. Focusing on the region above the Fermi energy, our results show that the symmetry potential plays a more important role in the experimental observables, such as double neutron to proton ratio and the isospin transport ratio R_i, than that the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section does. Since the copious production of intermediate mass fragments is a distinguishing feature of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, we also examined the influence of cluster emission on the isospin transport ratio using different isospin tracers. The values of the isospin transport ratios with the tracer defined by the isospin asymmetry of the heaviest fragments with Z ≥20 in the projectile region is greater than those obtained from projectile residues (emitting source). This phenomenon can be tested experimentally. By comparing the ImQMD05 predictions with the data for three observables, the self-consistent constraints on the symmetry energy at subsaturation density were obtained.","对称能的密度依赖形式对于中子星结构及其演化规律、不稳定核结构及其反应等都有非常重要的影响。由于目前理论上预言的对称能密度依赖形式有很大的不确定性，因此确定对称能的密度依赖形式已经成为目前核物理研究的一个重要课题。丰中子核重离子碰撞是目前在实验室条件下确定对称能密度依赖形式的一种重要手段，其主要的理论依据就是微观输运理论。首先回顾了目前输运理论的两个处理方法，即Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck(BUU)和量子分子动力学(QMD)方法，并重点介绍了改进的量子分子动力学模型(ImQMD05)。利用ImQMD05对中能重离子碰撞的一些基本观测量，如碎块分布、集体流、核核碰撞的阻止本领等进行了详细研究，通过与实验数据的比较，确定了ImQMD05中同位旋无关部分的平均场、介质中核子-核子散射截面。为了从重离子碰撞的实验数据确定对称能的密度依赖形式，详细研究了输运理论中对称势以及同位旋相关的介质中核子-核子散射截面对于同位旋敏感观测量的影响。研究显示，对于Fermi能附近的重离子碰撞，输运理论预言的同位旋敏感的观测量，如DR(n/p)和R_i，强烈依赖于对称势的软硬，而不敏感于介质中同位旋相关的核子-核子散射截面。多重碎裂作为中能重离子碰撞的一个主要特点，本文论述的研究显示碎块发射机制对同位旋敏感的观测量，出射核子的双中子质子之比DR(n/p)和同位旋转移之比R_i，都有重要影响。以重碎块的同位旋不对称度为探针得到的同位旋转移之比R_i（deltaz_(max)>20）要大于R_i(delta)，这些测量能够在NSCL/RIKEN的相关实验上进行测量。同时，这一现象的研究对于理解碎块的发射机制及碎块发射的特征时间等问题将有重要的帮助。为此，采用ImQMD05研究了~(112,124)Sn+~(112,124)Sn在入射能量50MeV/u，不同碰撞参数条件下的多个实验观测量，如DR(n/p)、同位旋扩散R_i，以及同位旋转移之比的快度分布。研究表明，模型能够同时自洽地解释这几个实验观测量，并通过与这些实验数据的分析比较，自洽地确定出低密区对称能密度依赖形式的范围。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron star is regarded as one of the occasions where r-process and p-process take place. Based on Newtonian hydrodynamics equations, we discuss the effect of three different equations of state (EOSs) (EOS-1 strict; EOS-2 ignoring the degenerate parameter; EOS-3 ignoring the gas pressure) on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of neutrino-driven wind. We find that (1) the EOS ignoring the degenerate parameter is a good approximation; (2) the EOS ignoring the gas pressure causes the density and temperature to decrease, and the speed and entropy per baryon to increase, but the electron fraction is almost not changed.

In this paper, according to the work of Zhu Cui, et al. (Zhu C, Gao Z F, Li X D, Wang N, Yuan J P, P_eng Q H 2016 Mod. Phys. Lett. A 31 1650070), we reinvestigate the Landau-level stability of electrons in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF), B ? B_(cr)(B_(cr) is a quantum critical magnetic field with a value of 4.414*10~(13) G), and its influence on the pressure of electrons in magnetar. First, we briefly review the pressure of electrons in neutron star (NS) with a weak-magnetic field limit (B ? B_(cr)). Then, we introduce an electron Landau level stability coefficient g_nu and a Dirac-delta function to deduce a modified pressure formula for the degenerate and relativistic electrons in an SMF in an application range of matter density rho ≥ 10~7 g・cm~(-3) and B_(cr)?B < 10~(17) G. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, the SMF can enhance the electron number density n_e, and reduce the maximum of electron Landau level number numax, which results in a redistribution of electrons. As B increases, more and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, and the electron Landau level stability coefficient g_nu will decrease with the augment of Landau energy-level number nu. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, the electron number density n_e increases with the MF strength increasing, leading the electron pressure P_e to increase. Utilizing the modified expression of electron pressure, we discuss the phenomena of Fermion spin polarization and electron magnetization in the SMF, and the modification of the equation of state by the SMF. We calculate the baryon number density, magnetization pressure, and the difference between pressures in the direction parallel to and perpendicular to the magnetic field in the frame of the relativistic mean field model. Moreover, we find that the pressure anisotropy due to the strong magnetic field is very small and can be ignored in the present model. We compare our results with the results from other similar studies, and examine their similarities and dissimilarities. The similarities include 1) the abnormal magnetic moments of electrons and the interaction between them are ignored; 2) the electron pressure relate to magnetic field intensity B, electron number density n_e and electron Fermi energy EeF, and the latter two are complex functions containing B; 3) with n_e and EeF fixed, P_e increases with B rising; 4) as B increases, the pressure-density curves fitted by the results from other similar studies have irregular protrusions or fluctuations, which are caused by the transformation of electron energy state from partial filling to complete filling at the nu-level or the transition of electrons from the nu to the (nu+1)-level. This phenomenon is believed to relate to the behavior of electrons near the Fermi surface in a strong magnetic field, which essentially reflects the Landau level instability. Finally, the future research direction is prospected. The present results provide a reference for future studies of the equation of state and emission mechanism of high-B pulsar, magnetar and strongly magnetized white dwarf.","当前脉冲星领域一个重要的研究热点是磁星.本文在朱翠等(Zhu C, Gao Z F, Li X D, Wang N, Yuan J P, P_eng Q H 2016 Mod.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Laboratory astrophysics is one of the youngest branches of astrophysics. Its name was coined about 30 years ago. It is successful because the physical laws we discover on Earth should work everywhere. We use laboratory experiments to expand our understanding of physical processes and then apply these results to the processes throughout the Universe. High energy density laboratory astrophysics (HEDLA) allows a depth study and comparison of the measurements produced by laboratory Z-pinches and lasers. In this paper, we review the recent progress in several fields of HEDLA, such as the supernova explosion, stellar jets, photoionized plasmas, stellar opacity and equation of state (EOS) and solar magnetic reconnection. In some cases laboratory experiments can reproduce similar physics. For example, the charged plasmas can be created in the laboratory to study the interactions among photons, electrons and ions that occur in the stars, the solar corona and the X-ray binaries. In other cases, we need some scales to study the processes behind the astrophysical phenomena by the experiments. For example, the evolution of a laboratory plasma jet, with typical spatial scales of a few mm and characteristic timescales of hundreds of ns, can be a scaled version of large-scale jets from young stars (typically thousands of astronomical units in length and evolving in timescales of many years). In order for this scaling to be valid, both the laboratory and astrophysical jets must have similar dimensionless parameters such as the Mach number, Reynolds number, and Peclet number. HEDLA is being paced by large experiments such as NIF, LMJ, and Shenguang lasers. New experimental techniques, improved simulations codes, and experimental diagnostics provide the ground-based testing which benefits our understanding of the Universe. The most powerful laser project is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), in which 196 laser beams deliver nearly 2 megajoules to a millimeter sized target, reproducing the plasma temperatures within stars. The updated experi-mental power makes HEDLA promising to explore more in the Universe and contribute more to the understanding of the astrophysical objects and processes.","近年来,随着用于高能量密度物理研究的实验装置如大功率激光器、磁力箍缩装置和托克马克等的发展,人们在实验室中可以使毫米尺度的物质达到极端高温、高压、高密度的状态,这使得在实验室环境中可以模拟天体物理环境中的物理条件及某些物理过程,从而推动了一个新兴科学领域--高能量密度实验室天体物理的发展。高能量密度实验室天体物理有很多重要的研究方向,包括超新星爆发过程中剧烈激波引发的非线性流体动力学不稳定性及其演化,原初恒星的喷流和高马赫数喷流,黑洞、中子星等致密天体周围的光致电离星风,不透明度的测量和天体磁场的重联现象等。在此选取高能量密度实验室天体物理中近年来几个研究方向的进展,对其进行系统地介绍,并对此领域的发展做出展望。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：It is predicted in many theories beyond the standard model that the new interaction relevant to spin is existent.The exchange of an axial vector particle will result in attractive dipole-dipole interaction which can be viewed as an effective magnetic potential that looks quite different from those expected from electromagnetism.In this work,we demonstrate that,instead of the laboratory spin source,stringent constraints can be set on these attractive spin-spin interactions from polarized nuclear matters within neutron stars which have extremely strong magnetic fields(up to 10~(15)G in some cases).By considering such an exotic interaction within the framework of relativistic mean field model,we find that the stability of infinite nuclear matter can be influenced significantly when the ratio of coupling strength to boson mass become larger than g_A~2/m_Z'~2~O(10 GeV~(-2)).Furthermore,based on the curvature matrix approach,when g_A~2/m_Z'~2 >130 GeV~(-2),phase transition inside low-density nuclear matter will no longer take place before the pressure of nuclear matter becomes zero,which forbids core-crust transition at the inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars.Thus bare neutron stars without any crusts are predicted.However,observations of pulsar glitches,i.e.,the occasional disruptions of the extremely regular pulsations from magnetized,rotating neutron stars,imply the existence of crusts inside these dense objects.This in turn constrains the strength of the exotic interaction.In fact,in the case of dipole-dipole force on a length scale between m to cm,the highest value of these constraints can be 8 orders of magnitude higher than those from existing laboratory results.","众多粒子物理超标准模型中都预言了自旋有关的新相互作用存在.极化的核子间通过交换自旋为1的轴矢量玻色子可以产生额外的吸引力进而改变无穷大核物质状态方程性质.本文在相对论平均场模型的框架下加入额外的轴矢量玻色子后计算发现,当相互作用强度与玻色子质量之比达到g_A~2/m_Z'~2~O(10 GeV~(-2))时,低密处无穷大核物质的稳定性和对应的相变行为将发生显著的改变;而当g_A~2/m_Z'~2 >130 GeV~(-2)时核物质将在发生相变前率先到达零压点.对中子星而言这意味着其内核物质将在保持稳定的状态下形成表面而不会发生相变形成壳层结构,这与普遍存在于中子星天文观测中的星震现象矛盾,因此反过来对新相互作用的强度提出了额外的限制.通过与已有的地面实验结果对比,本文发现对于力程为微米到厘米间的新相互作用,中子星对其强度的约束最高可有8个量级的提升."

This hadron-quark phase transition has important impact on neutron stars, which has received much attention.

The equilibrium conditions for coexisting hadronic and quark phases are derived by minimizing the total energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions. We employ the relativistic mean-field(RMF) model to describe the hadronic phase, while the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(NJL) model is used for the quark phase. We conclude that the finite-size effect will raise the stiffness of EOS, and then increase the maximum mass of neutron stars, which depend on the value of surface tension. Our results show that finite-size effects can significantly reduce the region of the mixed phase, and the results lie between those from the Gibbs and Maxwell constructions.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：It is generally believed that a neutron star mainly consists of four parts, that is to say, outer crust, inner crust, outer core, and inner core. From neutron drip density to crust-core transition density, the inner crust of neutron star is a nonuniform system where nuclei coexist with nucleon and electron gases surrounding them. As density increases, the nuclear pasta phases with different shapes, such as droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble may appear in the inner crust. Astronomical observations indicate that strong magnetic fields, which may be as high as 10~(18) G, may exist in some neutron stars. So, the crust structure of neutron star may be influenced significantly by the strong magnetic fields. Consequently, a number of astrophysical observations, such as the neutron star oscillations and glitches in the spin rate of pulsars may be affected by the properties of inner crust. In this paper, we adopt the relativistic mean-field theory to describe the nuclear interaction, and anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron are considered as well. In order to study the effects of strong magnetic fields on the properties of nonuniform nuclear matter in inner crust and crust-core transition of neutron stars, we adopt the Wigner-Seitz approximation to describe the nonuniform matter in inner crust, where only one nucleus exists in a Wigner-Seitz cell. Meanwhile, the charge neutrality and fi equilibrium conditions are satisfied. We adopt the self- consistent Thomas-Fermi approximation to obtain the distributions of nucleons and electrons in a Wigner-Seitz cell under strong magnetic fields, and then we calculate the binding energy per nucleon and the properties of Wigner-Seitz cell. It turns out that the properties of inner crust structure and the crust-core transition would not change much with strong magnetic fields B ≤ 10~(17) G comparing with B = 0. The nucleon distribution, binding energy per nucleon, radius of Wigner-Seitz cell, onset density of various nonspherical pasta phases, and crust-core density with B = 10~(17) G are very similar to the corresponding results with B = 0. However, the strong magnetic fields B ≥10~(18) G play an important role in determining the pasta phase structure. As a result, the radius of spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the binding energy per nucleon of various kinds of pasta phases, and the onset densities of nonspherical nuclei and crust-core transition decrease with increasing B, while the area of high density in Wigner-Seitz cell increases. For fixed strength of magnetic fields, as the average baryon density in Wigner-Seitz cell increases, the radius of Wigner-Seitz cell decreases, but the area of high density in the center of the cell increases. The nucleon density at the boundary of Wigner-Seitz cell increases with increasing average baryon density for fixed strength magnetic fields, while the nucleon density at the center area of the cell decreases, which leads to the nucleon distribution in the cell becomes more dispersive.","中子星内壳层是由原子核与其周围的自由中子气和电子气共存而构成的非均匀物质.天文观测表明部分中子星内部可能存在高达10~(18) G的强磁场.因此中子星的内壳层结构会受到强磁场的明显影响.本文采用相对论平均场理论描述核子间相互作用,并考虑了质子和中子的反常磁矩.利用Wigner-Seitz近似描述中子星内壳层中的非均匀分布物质,并采用自洽Thomas-Fermi近似方法处理在强磁场环境中Wigner- Seitz原胞内的核子以及电子分布,从而研究强磁场对中子星内壳层中的非均匀相结构以及壳核相变等性质的影响.计算结果表明,与无磁场情况相比,内壳层中非均匀物质的每核子结合能、原子核pasta相结构和壳核相变密度等性质在磁场B ≤ 10~(17) G的环境中不会发生明显变化.而B ≥10~(18) G的强磁场会对中子星内壳层中的pasta相结构产生重要影响,使各种pasta相的每核子结合能降低,非球形原子核出现的阈密度和壳核相变密度减小.随着磁场强度B的增加,球形Wigner-Seitz原胞的半径减小,同时原胞内的核子分布变得更加弥散."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Giant flares(GF) observed from the soft gamma-ray repeater(SGR) are generally believed to take place on the magnetar, a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field(10~(10) ~ 10~(11) T), and release huge amount of energy(> 10~(39) J) in a very short time interval(a few tens of seconds). They are thought to be the most energetic phenomenon in the universe next to the supernova and the gamma-ray burst. Currently, it is usually thought that the energy driving the GF from the SGR is from the magnetic field in the magnetosphere of the magnetar, the eruption is triggered by the catastrophic loss of equilibrium in the magnetic structure as a result of various instabilities in the structure, and magnetic reconnection subsequently converts most of the magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy of the plasma involved in the eruption. Meanwhile, a small portion of the magnetic energy is used to accelerate charged particles as well. In this review, we introduce the physical properties of magnetars and the observations of GF on SGR. So far, two types of models for GF exist, including the crust model and the magnetosphere model, distinguishing from one another by the region where the energy is stored prior to GF. The former assumes that the energy is stored in the crust of the neutron star, and the latter assumes that thestorage occurs in the magnetosphere. In the crust model,a giantflare is caused by a sudden untwisting of the internal magnetic field and subsequently a large and quick rotational displacement takes place. Alternatively, in the magnetosphere model, the magnetic energy is slowly stored in the magnetosphere until the system reaches a critical state and loses the mechanical equilibrium, triggering the eruption. Observations of the giant flare from SGR 1806-20 on 2004 December 27 showed that it lasted a very short rise time(0.25 ms). This time interval of the eruption is short compared to the timescale required for the crust model and is more consistent with the magnetosphere model. In this paper, some theoretical magnetosphere models are introduced. The magnetohydrodynamical(MHD) model for magnetar giant flares in the framework of the catastrophe model for the coronal mass ejection from the Sun is focused on. In this model, the rotation and/or displacement of the crust causes the field to twist, compress, stretch, and deform, leading to the formation of a magnetic flux rope in the magnetosphere, as well as slow accumulation of the magnetic energy in the related configuration. When the energy and helicity stored in the configuration reach a threshold, the system loses its equilibrium,the flux rope is ejected outward in a catastrophic way, and magnetic reconnection helps the catastrophe develop to a plausible eruption. The calculated light curves of SGR 1806-20,SGR 0526-66, and SGR 1900+14 are in good agreement with the observed light curves of these giant flares. In addition, some MHD simulations about the GF are introduced. Solving the MHD equations for different initial and boundary conditions, the GF can be duplicated in the numerical experiment, the evolution of magnetic configuration, including the current sheet where magnetic reconnection takes place, for the eruption could then be further obtained in detail.","软gamma重复暴(soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR)被认为产生于磁中子星。发生在SGR上的巨耀发在短时标内释放出大于10~(39) J的巨大能量,被认为是宇宙中已知最强的能量释放过程之一,其剧烈程度仅次于超新星爆发和gamma暴。详细介绍了几种磁球层理论模型,并重点介绍了以太阳爆发日冕物质抛射灾变理论为基础建立的磁中子星巨耀发的磁流体力学的半解析模型。在模型中,板块的转动或错位造成磁球层内磁场的扭缠,从而导致磁通量绳的形成和磁能缓慢的积累。当积累的能量超过阈值,系统就会失去平衡,然后产生爆发并释放能量。用该模型计算的SGR 1806-20, SGR 0526-66和SGR 1900+14这3次巨耀发的光变曲线都与观测基本相符。此外,有关磁中子星巨耀发的磁流体动力学的数值模拟工作也得到了全面的展开,通过求解各种初始条件和边界条件下的磁流体力学方程组,计算机的数值模拟可以得到磁中子星巨耀发过程中的磁场形态演化和内部精细结构。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short-duration flashes of gamma rays occurring at cosmological distances and the most violent explosive phenomena since the cosmic big bang. GRBs were accidentally discovered by Vela military satellites of United States in 1967. The BATSE instrument onboard the Compton Space Gamma-Ray Observatory found two types of GRBs, long-duration (T90 >2s) and short-duration (T90 < 2 s). In 1997, the BeppoSAX satellite for the first time made precise localization of long GRBs, leading to the discoveries of multi-wavelength afterglows, host galaxies and cosmo- logical redshifts of long GRBs. These milestone observations were selected by Science as one of the top ten scientific breakthroughs of the year. In 1999, long GRBs were found to be associated with the birth of stellar mass black holes. In 2003, the HETE-II satellite discovered the first direct association of a long GRB with a type Ic supernova, confirming that long GRBs are linked to the core collapse of massive stars. Science ranked these two major advances as one of the world's top ten scientific breakthroughs of the year in 1999 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the Swift satellite made the first accu- rate localization of short GRBs, leading to the discoveries of afterglows, host galaxies and redshifts of short GRBs. These observations provide indirect evidence that short GRBs originate from mergers of binary systems of compact objects (at least including one neutron star) at cosmological distances. In particular, on 2017 August 17, the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors, for the first time, discovered a GW event from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, GW170817. About 1.74 s after the merger, Fermi/GBM detected a short gamma-ray burst (named GRB170817A). Subsequently, many ground-based and space-based telescopes detected X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, nearly infrared, and radio counterparts to GW170817, especially including a multi-wavelength kilonova (named AT2017gfo). These discoveries mark the beginning of a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. To summarize, all the observations have shown that long bursts originate from the core collapse of massive stars and short bursts originate from the mergers of binary compact objects (at least including one neutron star); besides prompt gamma-ray emission, the sources of GRBs produce X-ray, optical and radio afterglows in timescales of weeks, months and years after the burst trigger, respectively. Theoretically, prompt gamma-ray emissions of GRBs are thought to arise from some energy dissipation processes in the interiors of relativistic jets and multi-wavelength afterglows arise from forward shocks due to collisions between the jets and their ambient media. Therefore, GRBs are not only astronomical laboratories of studying extremely physical phenomena (e.g., newborn compact objects including stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, gravitational waves, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and high-energy neutrinos) and of testing the basic physical principles with high accuracy, but also become an important probe of the star formation and evolution in the early universe, high-redshift galaxies, and cosmology. GRBs now are a multidisciplinary field (in- cluding astronomy, cosmology, and physics) and thus one of the most competitive fundamental research fields. In this paper, we review recent researches of GRBs and electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, by focusing on the relevant key scientific issues, and discuss how to seize the opportunity to plan the interdisciplinary strategy based on the development trend and the research foundation in China, to maximize domestic scientific equipment achievements, and to enhance Chinese international influence in this field.","伽玛射线暴(简称伽玛暴或gamma ray burst, GRB)是来自宇宙深处的、短时标的伽玛射线突然增强的现象,是宇宙大爆炸之后最猛烈的爆发现象.伽玛暴可分为长暴(持续时间T90 >2 s)和短暴(T90 < 2 s).观测发现,长暴起源于大质量恒星的塌缩,而短暴起源于双致密星的并合.除了瞬时伽玛辐射,伽玛暴分别在暴后周、月和年时间量级上还会产生X射线、光学和射电余辉.理论上,伽玛暴的瞬时辐射被认为产生于相对论喷流内部的能量耗散过程,而多波段的余辉则产生于相对论喷流与外部介质之间的相互碰撞引起的外激波.因此,伽玛暴是研究致密天体(恒星级质量黑洞和中子星)诞生、引力波辐射、相对论激波、极高能宇宙线、高能中微子等极端物理现象以及高精度检验基本物理原理的天文实验室,也是早期宇宙恒星形成和演化、高红移星系、高红移宇宙学的重要探针.伽玛暴的研究横跨当今天文学、宇宙学、物理学等学科,是当前国际竞争最激烈的自然科学基础研究领域之一. 2017年8月17日, LIGO(laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory)/Virgo引力波天文台和Fermi卫星同时分别探测到引力波事件GW170817和短时标伽玛暴GRB170817A,开辟了多信使天文学的新时代.本文结合相关的关键科学问题评述了伽玛暴和引力波电磁对应体研究领域的最新研究进展,并基于伽玛暴学科领域的发展态势和我国现有的研究基础,讨论如何抓住机遇、布局跨学科的重大研究计划,促进国内与伽玛暴相关科学设备成果的最大化,全面提升我国在这个领域的国际影响力."

GRB 170817A has an extremely weak luminosity, suggesting the jet may be off-axis to the line of sight. The relations between the peak energy E p,i and isotropic luminosity L iso , and between the Lorentz factor Gamma and L iso are used to determine the viewing angle theta'_(obs) and the Lorentz factor Gamma of short GRB 170817A and long short GRB 060614. The results show that, for GR-B 170817A Gamma = 45 27, and theta'_(obs) = 2.2 0.5 ° , for GRB 060614 Gamma = 214 93, and theta'_(obs) = 0.5 0.1 ° . This corresponds to the on-axis isotropic luminosity of GRB 170817A L_(iso,on) = (2.1 0.7) * 10~(49) erg ・ s~(-1) , two or three orders of magnitude less than the typical short GRBs. And the on-axis isotropic luminosity of GRB 060614 is L_(iso,on) = (5.12 1.91) * 10~(51) erg ・ s~(-1) , comparable to the isotropic luminosity of the typical short GRBs. It suggests that GRB 060614 may belong to the type of short GRBs, and GRB 170817A may be an intrinsically weak short GRBs.","伴随着引力波事件GW170817的短暴GRB(Gamma-Ray Burst) 170817A首次提供了双中子星并合与短暴相联系的直接证据. 但是短暴GRB 170817A具有非常弱的光度,意味着观测的视线方向可能偏离喷流轴方向. 根据短暴静止系的峰值能量E p,i和各向同性光度L iso之间的关系以及洛伦兹因子Gamma和L iso之间的关系估算了短暴GRB 170817A以及长短暴GRB 060614观测角与喷流边缘的夹角theta'_(obs)和洛伦兹因子Gamma,结果表明GRB 170817A的Gamma = 45 27, theta'_(obs) = 2.2 0.5 ° ,而GRB 060614的Gamma = 214 93, theta'_(obs) = 0.5 0.1 ° .这个结果相当于GRB 170817A的正轴各向同性光度L_(iso,on) =(2.1 0.7) * 10~(49) erg ・ s~(-1) ,比典型的短暴少2-3个数量级. GRB 060614的L_(iso,on) =(5.12 1.91) * 10~(51) erg ・ s~(-1)与典型短暴相当.这意味着GRB 060614可能属于短暴类型,而GRB 170817A可能本质上就是一个弱暴."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Fast Radio Bursts(FRBs)are extra-galactic origin milli-second duration bright radio bursts. Theoretically, FRBs may produce optical counterparts with durations from milliseconds to hours. The FRB optical counterparts may be detectable in future large field telescopes in China, including the China Space Station Survey Space Telescope(CSST), the 2.5-meter Large Field Survey Telescope(WFST)of the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC), and the Purple Mountain Observatory(PMO), and Earth 2.0(ET). The fast radio burst optical counterparts are grouped into millisecond time-scale optical counterparts, hourly time-scale optical counterparts, and optical afterglow for our study. The first two can be generated by the high-energy extension of FRBs or the radio radiation of fast radio bursts and the inverse Compton scattering of high-energy electrons. The event rates highly depend on the opticalradio flux ratio eta_v. For millisecond duration optical counterparts, the detection rate of WFST, CSST, and ET can reach hundreds per year in an ideal case. If eta_v ~ 10~(-3), the corresponding annual detection rates of WFST and CSST are in the order of 1, and the annual detection rate of ET is 19.5. For the hourly optical counterparts, ideally, the age of the supernova remnant is 5 years, eta_v is about 10~(-6), and the annual detection rates are above 100. The X-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 indicates that FRBs may produce relativistic outflow, which will interact with the interstellar medium to produce optical afterglows. Combined with the standard afterglow model, the detectability of optical afterglow is explored with a simulation of fast radio bursts following the redshift and energy distribution from the literature.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient and bright radio pulses from cosmological origins, which have two types: repeating FRBs and non-repeating FRBs. Based on the eccentric binary model for the origin of the periodic FRBs, we consider the effects of gravitational-wave (GW) radiation on the periodic activity of repeating FRBs. The compact binary system composed of a neutron star (NS) with a strong bipolar magnetic field and a magnetic white dwarf (WD) may be able to explain the repeated behavior of repeating FRBs. When WD fills its Roche lobe, mass transfer will occur through the inner Lagrange point to the surface of the NS. After an explosion, the WD may be kicked away owing to the conservation of angular momentum, and refills its Roche lobe at the next periastron, due to the decrease of orbital separation through GW radiation to realize another. In this scenario, the period of the repeating FRBs should be equivalent to the orbital period P_(orb). Thus, the relation between P_(orb) and the time interval of two adjacent mass-transfer processes Deltat is a key factor that may determine whether the periodic activity can show up. Obviously, DeltatP_(orb) or Deltat < P_(orb) is a necessary condition for the periodic activity to appear. On the contrary, for Deltat >> P_(orb), the periodicity will be hard to discover. The results show that the periodic activity is more likely to show up for relatively long periods, which may be the reason that only two sources having been claimed to have periodic activity, both correspond to relatively long periods.","在椭圆轨道的致密双星模型作为周期性重复快速射电暴(Fast Radio Bursts, FRBs)起源的基础上,考虑引力辐射对快速射电暴周期性行为的影响。这个双星系统包含一个具有强偶极磁场的中子星和一个磁化的白矮星。当白矮星充满它的洛希瓣时,物质将通过内拉格朗日点转移到中子星表面。由于角动量守恒,白矮星可能在一次爆发之后被踢开,接着在演化过程中由于引力辐射再次充满洛希瓣,实现再次爆发。这种情况下,快速射电暴的周期对应于双星轨道周期P_(orb),而它与两次质量转移时间间隔Deltat之间的关系是能否显现周期性行为的关键因素。很明显, DeltatP_(orb)或者Deltat < P_(orb)是周期性行为显现的必要条件。反之,如果 Deltat >> P_(orb),周期性将很难观测到。结果表明,只有相对较长周期的快速射电暴才能显示周期性行为,这表明目前仅有的两个周期性快速射电暴都对应于较长的周期是合理的。"

In this work, by making use of a conservative symmetry energy slope (SES) range (25 MeV<115 MeV), the constraints from the SES on the structures and properties of static and rapid rotating neutron stars are investigated. The constraint properties include the mass-radius relations, the moments of inertia, the redshift, the deformations of the rapid rotating stars, etc. According to the conservative SES range, it is shown that the radius of a canonical neutron star (with M = 1.4M_⊙) can be constrained in a region of 10.28 s 13.43 km, which is consistent with one of the latest constraints on the radius of neutron star in observations. It is also shown that if a sub-millisecond pulsar with a lighter stellar mass is observed in the future, then a softer SES of the asymmetric nuclear matters is preferred. The universal property of the angular momentum provides a way to obtain the upper limit of the moment of inertia of a rapid rotating neutron star with observed mass.

One set of coupling constants GL85 in RMF are selected to reproduce the mass of PSR J0348+0432 at zero temperature, and then extended to describe the massive protoneutron stars with the per baryon entropy S = 1 or S = 2. It is found that the massive protoneutron stars have more hyperons than the cold neutron stars, the temperature increases with the increase of the density from surface to interior, and the existence of hyperons leads to the decrease of the interior temperature. Entropy causes the increase of the mass of massive protoneutron star, and this effect is more obvious than that of the decreasing mass due to hyperons. The entropy per baryon brings on the increase of the radius of protoneutron star.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：By statistically analyzing the masses of the twelve double neutron star (DNS) systems, it is conclude that the weighted mean value of their neutron star (NS) masses is (1.3390.042)M_⊙, where the weighted mean masses of the primaries and companions are (1.4390.036)M_⊙ and (1.2390.020)M_⊙, respectively. The mean value of the masses of the primaries is higher than that of the companions, which indicates that the primaries may increase their masses by accretion, or the mass of progenitors of the primaries is higher. Therefore, the physical process of supernova explosion through which the high-mass stars become NSs can be investigated. Also it is found that the total masses of the DNSs span a narrow range of 2.5-2.8 M_⊙, implying that the companions might impact on the mass formation of DNSs. Moreover, the mass ratios of the DNSs (primaries to companions) approximate 1 (slightly larger than 1), indicating that the masses of the progenitors of the primaries are approximately equal to the masses of the progenitors of the companions. By analyzing the distribution of the 12 DNSs in the surface magnetic field strength versus spin period (B-P_s) diagram, it is found that the surface magnetic field strength of the primaries of the DNSs is ~ 10~(10) Gs and the spin period is ~ 50 ms; while two pulsars, i.e. PSR J1906+0746 and PSR J0737- 3039B, are located in the region of normal pulsars in the B-P_s diagram, whose surface magnetic field strength is ~ 10~(12) Gs, suggesting that they might not be accelerated through accretion.","通过对12对双中子星(DNS)系统进行质量分布统计, 得到其质量加权平均值为(1.3390.042) M_⊙, 其中主星和伴星的质量加权平均值分别为(1.4390.036) M_⊙和(1.2390.020) M_⊙. 主星平均质量比伴星平均质量高, 表明主星可能通过吸积获得质量, 或者主星的前身星的质量更大. 据此可以分析大质量恒星通过超新星爆发形成中子星的物理过程. 此外还发现, DNS的总质量集中在一个比较狭小的范围(2.5-2.8 M_⊙), 这说明DNS的质量形成受到伴星的影响. 经过进一步的分析注意到DNS的质量比接近于1(略大于1), 这可能暗示DNS系统的前身星质量比较相近. 通过分析12对DNS在中子星的磁场强度-自旋周期关系图(B-P_s图)中的分布, 发现DNS主星磁场强度约10~(10) Gs, 自转周期约50 ms; PSR J1906+0746和PSR J0737-3039B处在正常脉冲星序列, 磁场强度约10~(12) Gs, 这说明两者没有吸积加速过程."

It is further proved by our calculation that the EOS around 2 times of the saturation nuclear density has an obvious imprint on the stellar radius of a typical neutron star. In addition, we also investigate the dependence of the mass-radius curve and its slope (dM/dR) on the EOS. It is found that the slope (dM/dR) is mainly determined by the EOS above the saturation nuclear density. In fact, the investigations above will provide some useful theoretical reference.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Aquila X-1 (Aql X-1) is a neutron-star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), and a transient in radio and X-ray observations. VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) observations of Aql X-1 play an essential role in the jet-disk coupling study of NS-LMXBs. They also offer locations of Aql X-1 with sub-mas precision, which can be used in astrometric purpose. Since Aql X-1 exhibits X-ray bursts with evident photospheric radius expansion (PRE burst), the model-independent astrometry (here parallax) can help estimate the luminosity of the PRE bursts, and facilitate the theoretical modeling of PRE bursts. The two reported (in 2009 November and 2013 June) VLBI detections of Aql X-1 reduce the search area of Aql X-1 in other VLBI observations, and effectively lower the S/N threshold of new detections. We devised a procedure to a) determine the search region of the target source with its prior positional information, b) estimate the confidence level of the potential detection using the search region and the statistical information from the relevant VLBI dirty map. This procedure is especially suitable for radio-weak sources with prior positional information. Following this procedure we re-analysed two sets of VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) data obtained in the 2010 January and 2010 July observations, and find two new detections with confidence level of 99.9986% and 99.998 4% respectively. The detections, suitable for astrometric usage, correspond to inconsistent locations showing a displacement towards southwest, which agrees with the previously reported proper motion of Aql X-1. Additionally, the two new radio detections are associated with state transitions of X-ray emission, supporting the widely accepted belief that radio flux of an atoll source is mainly generated at the transitions between hard and soft X-ray state during X-ray outbursts.","天鹰座X-1(Aquila X-1, Aql X-1)是一个低质量中子星X射线双星,在X射线和射电波段表现为暂现源.对该源的甚长基线干涉(very long baseline interferometry, VLBI)观测不仅为中子星X射线双星的射电-X射线(或喷流-吸积盘)相关性研究提供了观测依据,而且VLBI亚毫角秒级的定位精度还有助于实现对该源的天体测量(包括位置、视差和自行).由于Aql X-1常伴随着光球层膨胀(photospheric radius expansion, PRE)特征的I型X射线暴(X-ray burst),因此,独立于物理模型的视差测量可以用来估算这类X射线暴的本征光度,并有助于对该类X射线暴的理论研究.Aql X-1已在2009年11月和2013年6月的2个历元的VLBI观测中被探测到,这使得它在其他历元的VLBI观测中的搜寻范围显著变小,并大大降低了其他历元的VLBI观测的探测阈值.处理并分析了观测时间为2010年1月和2010年7月的两组VLBA(Very Long Baseline Array)的历史数据,并证认了Aql X-1的2个新的亚毫秒级精度的VLBI探测,其置信度分别达到99.9986%和99.9984%.此外,2010年7月Aql X-1出现在其2010年1月位置的西南面,这与之前发布的Aql X-1的自行方向大体一致,意味着Aql X-1在2个历元间的位移主要来源于自行.最后发现,这2个VLBI观测的历元正对于X射线的软硬态转换窗口,这符合之前对该源的射电-X射线的相关性研究结果."

On the other hand,local density fluctuations in the early Universe could also form primordial black holes of stellar mass. Since the dawn of the Universe,stellar-mass black holes(SBHs)can come together to form binaries through mechanisms such as coevolution and dynamical processes. Before ground-based gravitational wave(GW)detectors made their first successful detections,the masses of SBHs had been measured by electromagnetic waves only,and never exceeded around 15 solar masses. The LIGO/Virgo detection of GWs from binary SBH mergers has drawn the attention of many scientists,in particular,the GW signals resulting from the inspirals of binary SBHs should be detectable by space-borne GW detectors. Based on the number of GW events detected by groundbased detectors,it is expected that TianQin will be able to detect a few to dozens of GW events related to inspirals of binary SBHs.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：On September 14, 2015, the first detection of gravitational waves at the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, in the United States, marked the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy, that opens a new window looking into the violent sides of our Universe. It is very promising that at other wavelengths detections of gravitational waves with various space-based and ground-based observatories will show up in the near future of this century. These observatories include space-based laser interferometer antennas, pulsar timing arrays, cosmic microwave background satellites, etc. The field of gravitational waves will reveal a lot of new information on the unknown aspects of our Universe, including, (i) the cosmic inflation in the early Universe, (ii) the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, and supermassive black hole binaries that are related to the history of galaxy mergers, (iii) the stellar evolution of binary systems, especially the stellar mass black hole binaries, (iv) the inspiral and subsequent merger of binary neutron stars, and the equation of state of superdense nuclear matters, (v) various fundamental aspects of gravitational theories, and so on. To guarantee the success of gravitational-wave observations, many aspects of gravitational-wave detectors have to be addressed, especially the principles of design, the understanding of various noises and possible ways to eliminate and/or suppress these noises. In the paper, we briefly review the physics of the general relativity and gravitational waves. Different classes of gravitational-wave detectors operating or to be operated at complementary wavelength bands from nano-Hz to kilo-Hz are presented, while their various noises and practical methods to overcome them are also discussed. The two Chinese projects, Taiji and TianQin, which are both proposed as space-based laser interferometer antennas, are reviewed. Their brief histories, project rationales, scientific aims, pros and cons in the upcoming gravitational-wave era, are discussed. We also review the expected fruitful science to our understandings of astrophysics and cosmology with the gravitational-wave astronomy, with more gravitational-wave detections. Gravitational waves bring in information that is complementary to what can be obtained with electromagnetic observations. For example, gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars are supposed to reveal the mechanism of the progenitor of short gamma-ray burst. The possible joint observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts will lead to a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. Finally, the first direct detection event, GW150914, and the merger of binary black holes behind the scene, are discussed in context.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：In order to meet the requirements of high precision for space-based gravitational-wave detection, the design of control systems for a drag-free satellite is researched from the point of view of dynamics and control theory. Based on the LISA Pathfinder mission, the drag-free satellite contains two test masses, and its control system includes an attitude control loop, a drag-free control loop, and an electrostatic-suspension control loop. Drag-free control technology is employed for the drag-free control loop, where a test mass is in a state of free fall, and the satellite platform is controlled to follow the test mass strongly in order to achieve a high-level microgravity of the satellite platform and the test mass. Active vibration-isolation control technology is applied in the electrostatic-suspension control loop, where the other test mass is controlled to follow the satellite platform weakly and is isolated from vibrations of the satellite platform, so as to achieve high-level microgravity of the test mass and avoid collisions between the test mass and the satellite platform. The frequency-domain characteristics of the two control technologies are analyzed, assuming them to be based on the PID control algorithm. A set of formulas for calculating the parameters for the PID controllers are established, so that the parameters can be determined quickly according to the performance requirements for these controllers. On this basis, a control strategy is proposed and the PID controllers are designed. The effectiveness of the control strategy and the accuracy of the controller parameters are verified through numerical simulations.","本文面向空间引力波探测高精度要求,从动力学与控制论的角度,对无拖曳卫星控制系统进行了研究.参考LISA Pathfinder模型,无拖曳卫星包含两个检验质量,其控制系统包括卫星平台姿态控制回路、无拖曳控制回路和静电悬浮控制回路.无拖曳控制回路采用无拖曳控制技术,检验质量处于自由落体状态,控制卫星平台强跟随检验质量,实现检验质量和卫星平台的高微重力水平.静电悬浮控制回路采用了主动隔振控制技术,控制检验质量弱跟随卫星平台,衰减从卫星平台传递到检验质量的振动扰动,实现检验质量的高微重力水平,同时避免检验质量与传感器的电极笼碰撞.基于Proportional-Integral-Differentive(PID)控制算法,分析了两种控制技术的频域特性,并推导了PID控制器参数的计算公式,由此可以根据控制性能要求快速地确定控制器参数.随后,本文提出了一种控制策略,设计了PID控制器,通过数值仿真验证了控制策略的有效性和控制器参数的准确性."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective The influence of the installation and adjustment error of gravitational wave telescopes on the TTL coupling noise of the telescopes is studied. Since the TTL coupling noise is the second largest noise source, during the actual engineering of gravitational wave telescopes, the installation and adjustment will affect the TTL coupling noise, with little correlation between the telescope′s installation and adjustment and TTL coupling noise. Therefore, the research on the relationship between the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance and TTL coupling noise is significant for the engineering of gravitational wave telescopes, and how the gravitational wave telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance will affect the TTL coupling noise determines whether the final gravitational wave telescope meets the requirements for use. The research results can guide the installation and installation and adjustment of gravitational wave telescopes. Methods We can judge the installation and adjustment processes of gravitational wave telescopes by simulating and designing a gravitational wave telescope that meets the requirements of the wave-front difference index, calculating the TTL coupling noise of the designed telescope, and analyzing the influence of the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance on the TTL coupling noise. The variable of installation and adjustment tolerance is sensitive to TTL coupling noise. By controlling the variable method with other parameters unchanged, only a certain installation and adjustment tolerance is assigned in the gravitational wave telescope, and the influence of the installation and adjustment tolerance in the telescope on the change of the exit pupil position is simulated and analyzed. Then when the laser interference signal passes through the laser interferometer and finally interferes with the four-quadrant detector, the variation of TTL coupling noise due to the installation and adjustment tolerance of the telescope is calculated. The relationship between the TTL coupling noise of the intersatellite laser interferometry system and the sensitivity of the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance is established. In addition, the requirements of the TTL coupling noise are employed as the criterion to establish the model relationship between the installation and adjustment tolerance and the change of TTL coupling noise. Results and Discussions Comparison shows that the distance tolerance between the primary mirror and the secondary mirror of the gravitational wave telescope exerts more influence on the TTL coupling noise of the gravitational wave telescope than the distance tolerance between other optical elements exerts on the TTL coupling noise. The change in TTL coupling noise due to the distance tolerance between the primary and secondary mirrors is opposite in sign to that due to the distance tolerance between the secondary and third mirrors and between the third and fourth mirrors. The installation and adjustment tolerance of the distance between the diaphragm and the primary mirror has little effect on the variation of the TTL coupling noise and can be ignored. The variation of the TTL coupling noise caused by the distance installation and adjustment tolerance of each optical element and the jitter angle are distributed in a parabolic law. By analyzing the installation and adjustment tolerance of the gravitational wave telescope, the relationship between the installation and adjustment tolerance of the gravitational wave telescope and the change of TTL coupling noise is established. Via the above analysis and discussion, the sensitivity of the TTL coupling noise of the gravitational wave telescope is known. The primary and secondary distance sensitivity of the mirror is the highest, which is 15.489 times the sensitivity of the secondary and third mirrors, and 9.311 times the sensitivity of the third and fourth mirrors.","本文研究了引力波望远镜的装调误差对望远镜的TTL(tilt-to-length,角度抖动与光程读出之间的)耦合噪声的影响。保持其他参量不变,仅对引力波望远镜中的某项装调公差进行赋值,仿真分析引力波望远镜中的某项装调公差对出瞳位置变化的影响,进而计算出激光干涉信号经过全玻璃激光干涉仪最终在四象限光电探测器上进行干涉时,由于引力波望远镜的装调公差的存在导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化情况。通过对比发现,引力波望远镜的主镜与次镜的距离公差,对引力波望远镜的TTL耦合噪声的影响大于其他光学元件之间的距离公差对TTL耦合噪声的影响。主镜和次镜之间的距离公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化与次镜和三镜之间的距离公差、三镜和四镜之间的距离公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化符号相反;光阑和主镜之间的距离装调公差对TTL耦合噪声的变化影响很小,可以忽略不计。各个光学元件的距离装调公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化量与抖动角度之间呈抛物线规律分布。在装调空间引力波望远镜时,应着重控制主镜与次镜之间的距离误差。并且可以使用次镜和三镜之间的距离装调误差、三镜和四镜之间的距离装调误差导致的TTL耦合噪声来抵消由装调主镜和次镜之间的距离误差导致的TTL耦合噪声。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The electromagnetic suspension (EMS) type high-speed maglev vehicleis driven by the long-stator linear synchronous motor. The excitation magnetic poles of motor areal so the electromagnets of suspension system, thus there is a serious nonlinear coupling relationship between the traction and levitation force of vehicle. The adjustment of the suspension system during operation will affect the traction system, which leads to traction force fluctuations. In this paper, a mathematical model of linear synchronous motor considering the influence of the suspension system is established. Aiming at the problem of traction fluctuations, a control strategy based on flux observation is proposed, which uses the extended electromotive force (EEMF) method to observe the flux. By applying the flux parameter to the speed loop and current loop, the q-axis current can be adjusted online to suppress the low-frequency traction fluctuation caused by the suspension system. However, the performance of this strategy is limited when the flux observation error exists at low speed region. Accordingly, a composite control strategy combining active disturbance rejection and flux observation algorithm is proposed, which compensates the flux observation error and other disturbances through the extend state observer (ESO). The results of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments show that the control strategy effectively suppresses the traction fluctuation caused by the influence of the suspension system, and improves the anti-load disturbance ability and dynamic performance.","常导电磁式高速磁悬浮列车采用长定子直线同步电机驱动,电机的励磁磁极同时也是悬浮电磁铁,车辆的牵引力和悬浮力存在严重的非线性耦合关系,运行过程中悬浮系统的调节会对牵引系统造成影响,引起牵引力波动。该文建立考虑悬浮系统影响的长定子直线同步电机数学模型,针对牵引力波动问题,提出一种基于磁链观测的控制策略,该策略基于扩展反电动势法来观测磁链,通过将磁链参数应用于速度环和电流环,在线调整定子q轴电流从而抑制由悬浮系统引起的低频牵引力波动。但该策略在低速时磁链观测存在误差、性能受限,在此基础上提出结合自抗扰和磁链观测的复合控制策略,通过扩张状态观测器补偿磁链观测误差以及其余扰动。硬件在环实验结果表明,该控制策略有效地抑制了悬浮系统影响造成的牵引力波动,提高了磁悬浮列车的抗负载扰动能力和系统动态性能。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Cryogenic technology is one of the key technologies for the next generation of Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave detector.The Japanese gravitational wave interferometer KAGRA (Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector),as the pathfinder of this technology,will operate in a 20 K cryogenic environment and use a sapphire single crystal with less thermal noise at low temperatures as the test mirror.However,sapphire crystals with high quality,large size,and low absorption rate are extremely difficult in manufacturing.In addition,due to the inhomogeneity of lattice structure in the sapphire crystal,it is easy to cause unnecessary birefringence effects,thereby affecting the target sensitivity of the detector.Based on the above problems,this paper developed two large-size optical measurement systems,and for the first time studied the optical characteristics of KAGRA cryogenic sapphire test mirrors systematically.First of all,according to the requirements of the detector for the thermal noise of the test mirror,we developed an optical measurement system based on the photothermal common-path interferometer technique,which can characterize the optical absorption of the test mirror and the surface coating of the test mirror effectively.Secondly,based on the optical absorption measurement system,we developed the birefringence effect measurement system,which can characterize the uniformity of birefringence in the test mirror.At present,the construction and testing of these two measurement systems have been completed,and the measurement sensitivity of the optical absorption of the sapphire test mirror has reached 1.5 ppm/cm.As for the birefringence measurement system,its spatial resolution is less than 0.3 mm * 0.3 mm.This work is of high significance for reducing the birefringence effect of large-size cryogenic test mirrors and improving the sensitivity of the detector.","低温制冷技术是下一代激光干涉仪引力波探测器的核心技术之一.日本引力波探测器KAGRA (Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector)作为该技术的前沿开拓者,将运行在20 K的超低温环境中,并使用在低温下热噪声较低的单晶蓝宝石晶体作为测试镜.然而,高质量大尺寸低吸收率的蓝宝石晶体极难制备.此外,由于蓝宝石晶体存在晶格结构不均匀,很容易导致不必要的双折射效应,从而影响探测器的目标灵敏度.基于上述问题,开发了两套大尺寸光学测量系统,首次系统研究了KAGRA低温蓝宝石测试镜的光学特性.首先,根据探测器对测试镜热噪声的要求,开发了一套基于光热共光路干涉技术的光学测量系统,该系统可对测试镜以及测试镜表面涂层的光学吸收进行有效的表征.其次,基于光学吸收测量系统,开发了一套双折射效应测量系统,该系统可以有效表征测试镜中双折射的均匀性.目前两套测量系统的搭建与调试已完成,对蓝宝石测试镜光学吸收的测量灵敏度达到了1.5 ppm/cm,双折射测量系统的空间分辨率小于0.3 mm * 0.3 mm.该工作对降低大尺寸低温测试镜双折射效应及提高探测器灵敏度具有重要意义."

In this work, we report a low-noise single-frequency laser designed for space-based gravitational wave detector. The laser is based on a master oscillator power amplifier(MOPA), which is designed to possess a low-power, narrow-linewidth seed laser acting as master oscillator(MO)and an all polarization-maintaining fiber amplifier acting as power amp lifier(PA). The amplifier that uses a robust mechanical design consists of an Yb-doped double-clad fiber forward pumped by wavelength-locked 976 nm pump laser diode(LD)to achieve 2.13 W of output power and 70 dB of signal-noise ratio(SNR). To suppress the relative intensity noise(RIN)in a millhertz regime(1 mHz-1 Hz), we characterize the power stabilization of a pump diode laser based on a proportional-integral-derivative(PID)feedback control loop where an in-loop photodetector is used. The power fluctuation can be converted into the fluctuation of the current signal by the photodiode, the current signal is converted into the voltage signal and amplified by a transimpedance circuit. Then, the voltage signal is compared with the voltage reference signal, and the error signal is achieved to adjust real-timely the drive current of the pump laser diode. This is a good way to significantly suppress the RIN of a laser at low frequencies, but the measured RIN below 4 mHz is still higher than -60 dBc/Hz. In order to further suppress the RIN to lower than 4 mHz, an active precise temper ature control technology is used to suppress the thermal noise from pump LD and fiber coupler. To assess the RIN milliertz regime, we design an RIN measurement system consisting of a high-precision signal acquisition card(24 bit)and a computer program based on LabVIEW. The measurement range of the system is 2 muHz - 102.4 kHz and the frequency resolution up to 2 muHz, much better than the counterparts of commercial instruments. By stabilizing the fiber amplifier pump LD current and the temperature of pump LD and the temperature of fiber coupler, the out-of-loop RINs are measured to be -63.4 dBc/Hz@1 mHz and -105.8 dBc/Hz@1 Hz, and in a milliertz regime of 1 mHz-1 Hz, the RIN is below -60 dBc/Hz. The results show that the feedback control of the fiber amplifier pump LD current and the temperature control of the key devices can effectively suppress the RIN in the millihertz frequency band, which lays a foundation for further improving the intensity noise performance in the low frequency band.","低噪声单频激光器是空间引力波探测系统中的核心器件,其噪声性能直接影响空间引力波探测器的灵敏度.本文报道了一种面向空间引力波探测的低噪声单频激光器,利用全保偏光纤结构的功率放大器对低功率、窄线宽、低噪声的非平面环形振荡器输出激光进行放大.为降低激光的强度噪声,比较了不同泵浦源的输出特性,为光纤放大器选用波长锁定的泵浦源,降低泵浦光波长随温度漂移对输出功率的影响,利用光电负反馈控制技术抑制输出激光的强度噪声,结合主动精确控温技术抑制关键器件的热噪声,实现了毫赫兹频段强度噪声的抑制.利用自主搭建的4通道相对强度噪声测量系统,测得反馈控制后的激光器相对强度噪声在1 mHz-1 Hz频段内低于-60 dBc/Hz,在1 mHz和1 Hz处分别为-63.4 dBc/Hz和-105.8 dBc/Hz.研究结果表明,通过放大器泵浦电流的反馈控制和关键器件的温度控制可以有效地抑制激光器在毫赫兹频段的强度噪声,为进一步提高低频段强度噪声性能奠定基础."
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Gravitational Waves(GWs)are ripples of space-time that propagate across the universe at the speed of light. GWs detection is one of the most important frontiers of physics today. Ground-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, have successfully confirmed the existence of GWs. GWs have become a new window for a human to observe the universe. Due to the influence of ground vibration noise,terrestrial gravity gradient noise and other factors,groundbased detectors are not sensitive to GWs below 1 Hz. Space-based detectors are free from such noises and can be made very large,thereby expanding the frequency range downwards to 10-4 Hz,where exciting GW sources are waiting to be explored. Space-based GW detectors are expected to bring even more information about the universe through low-frequency GWs. A highly stable and long-lifetime laser system is a key component of the space-based GW detector,and the output power,intensity noise,frequency noise and other properties of the laser directly affect the sensitivity of the space-based GW detector. Thus, space-based GW detectors put forward much higher and stricter requirements for the laser. After widely experimental and industrial surveys,the baseline architecture for the laser for space-based GW detector consists of a low-power, low-noise master oscillator followed by a power amplifier with 2~10 W continuous-wave output. So,lasers consisting of a Master Oscillator and a Power Amplifier (MOPA) have been identified as the most-promising architecture for the space-based GW detector. In this review, we focused on the research progress of low-noise MOPA lasers in LISA,TianQin and Taiji missions. As in other applications of precision interferometry,1064 nm was chosen as the laser wavelength,due to the availability of high-quality bulk optics and the traditional low-noise Nd:YAG laser source represented by the Non-Planar Ring Oscillator(NPRO).The performance of different MOPA lasers for LISA injected by NPRO(m-NPRO),fiber laser and External Cavity Diode Laser(ECDL)were compared,and the m- NPRO has been identified as the most-promising MO architecture for the LISA laser,and the baseline architecture consists of a low-power,low-noise m-NPRO followed by a diode-pumped Yb-fiber amplifier with ~2 W output. As for the Relative Intensity Noise (RIN), the m-NPRO meets the LISA requirement. As to the Chinese space-based GW detection projects,the research progress and spatial test results of lasers were elaborated. A DBR laser was designed for the TianQin-1 mission as the space laser in the laser interferometer,and was successfully verified in the TianQin-1 mission. The laser passed the environment performance verification under the aerospace standard. Meanwhile,a high stability laser source at 1064 nm for Taiji-1 satellite was reported. The key component of the laser source was a NonPlanar Ring Oscillator(NPRO)solid laser with linewidth of 260 Hz. The frequency noise and power noise of Laser source were greatly improved by applying precision driving current control and temperature control.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) GRB 170817A was the first observed GRB associated with a gravitational-wave event, providing a valuable opportunity to further study the producing mechanism of SGRBs. Its multi-wavelength afterglow emissions probably reveal the angular structure of the jet to us. And, if the jet structure is described phenomenologically by a Gaussian function, large sample statistical studies on SGRBs show that we probably need to introduce two-Gaussian functions to unify the emissions from GRB 170817A with other normal SGRBs. In other words, GRB 170817As prompt emission is likely from an additional component of a jet with a larger angle. Therefore, in order to test the compatibility between this two-Gaussian jet structure and the afterglow data of GRB 170817A, we calculate the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves from such an off-axis jet structure, and find that the introduction of the outer Gaussian component can well explain the early uptrend of the GRB 170817A afterglow data. On this basis, we also calculate the propagation and breakout processes of the jet in the merger ejecta, which shows that these processes can naturally lead to the two-Gaussian jet structure obtained by the observational constraint, thus showing the overall self-consistency of the model. Furthermore, the observational constraint on the jet propagation process also provides a new clue for understanding the properties of merger ejecta.","短时标伽马射线暴(简称短暴) GRB 170817A是人类发现的第一个与引力波事件成协的伽马暴,为深入研究短暴的发生机制提供了宝贵的机会,其中它的多波段余辉辐射很可能展示了喷流的角向结构.而有关短暴的大样本统计研究表明,如果用高斯函数来唯象描述喷流结构,很可能需要引入两个高斯函数才能够把GRB 170817A的辐射和其他普通的短暴统一起来.换言之, GRB 170817A的瞬时辐射很可能来自具有更大张角的额外喷流成分.因此,为了检验这种双高斯喷流结构和GRB 170817A余辉数据的相容性,本文计算了该喷流结构在偏轴观测下的多波段余辉,发现外高斯成分的引入能够很好地解释GRB 170817A余辉数据的早期上扬趋势.在此基础上,我们还计算了喷流在并合抛射物中的传播和突破过程,表明这些过程可以自然导致观测限制所得的双高斯喷流结构,从而展现出了模型的整体自洽性.此外,对喷流传播过程的观测限制也为我们了解并合抛射物的性质提供了新的线索."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective High-power narrow-linewidth fiber lasers are widely used in coherent synthesis and spectral synthesis;however,their power expansion is limited owing to stimulated Brillouin scattering.Common methods for inhibiting stimulated Brillouin scattering include the design and fabrication of stimulated Brillouin scattering suppression fibers and changing the temperature field and stress field distributions of the fibers.However,these methods entail complicated processing and can easily produce noise.In recent years,phase modulation of the light field has become the main method for suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering.In the linewidth range of 50 GHz,single-stage phase modulation has a limited threshold boost for stimulated Brillouin scattering.In this study,we report a highpower narrow-linewidth fiber laser based on a cascaded pseudo-random binary sequence and sinusoidal phase modulation.The proposed method is expected to contribute to the power scaling amplification of narrow-linewidth fiber lasers in the 50-GHz linewidth range.Methods In this study,the appropriate pseudo-random binary sequence phase modulation parameters and low-pass-filter cutoff frequency are selected so that the unit spectral linewidth has the greatest suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering.The effects of the modulation frequency and depth of sinusoidal phase modulation on the laser spectrum are studied.By changing the modulation frequency and depth,a spectral form with a fundamental frequency as high as the sideband of the 1 level is obtained.After cascading the pseudo-random binary sequence and sinusoidal phase modulation,the spectrum shows a near-flat-top morphology,which exhibits good stimulated Brillouin scattering suppression.According to the theoretical research results,a high-power narrow-linewidth fiber laser based on cascaded phase modulation is constructed,and the output powers and stimulated Brillouin scattering thresholds are compared at root mean square (RMS) linewidths of 20 GHz and 46 GHz.Results and Discussions Based on previous research,when the pseudo-random binary sequence phase modulation depth is 0.55pi and the ratio of filter cutoff frequency to modulation frequency is 0.53,the modulation spectrum exhibits a near-flat-top morphology(Fig.2).According to theoretical research,the depth of sinusoidal modulation influences the number of spectral lines and the relative intensity of spectral lines,and the results are shown in Fig.3.As the modulation depth increases,the number of spectral lines increases and the relative intensity of the spectral lines also changes.When the modulation frequency is reduced,the spectral line spacing and spectral linewidth are also significantly reduced.When the sinusoidal modulation frequency is 9.7 GHz and the modulation amplitude is 0.458pi,the modulation spectrum has three single frequencies (Fig.4).After cascading the pseudo-random binary sequence and sinusoidal phase modulation,the flatter spectral morphology than that from single-stage pseudo-random binary phase modulation is obtained,and the stimulated Brillouin scattering suppression is better.Based on the above research,a narrow-linewidth laser is built,and the output power and backward transmission power at RMS linewidths of 20 GHz and 46 GHz are monitored in the experiment (Fig.7).When the RMS linewidth is 20 GHz and the output power is 2.2 kW,the backward power increases exponentially.When the RMS linewidth is 46 GHz,the output power is close to the SBS threshold.Because the stimulated Brillouin scattering phenomenon is not observed in the experiment,the power is increased to 4.93 kW,yielding a stimulated Brillouin scattering threshold enhancement factor of ~328,a system slope efficiency of 78%,and a beam quality factor (M 2) below 1.2.","高功率窄线宽光纤激光器在遥感测量、引力波探测、光束合成等领域中应用广泛,但硅基光纤中的受激布里渊散射效应限制了其输出功率。对单频种子源进行相位调制以展宽线宽是常见的抑制受激布里渊散射的方法。然而,单一机理的射频相位调制对受激布里渊散射效应的阈值提升能力有限,已经不能满足近5 kW的激光功率需求。分析了伪随机二进制序列和正弦信号级联的相位调制对光谱展宽和受激布里渊散射效应抑制的影响,搭建了级联相位调制的高功率窄线宽光纤激光器,采用四级功率放大结构,在46 GHz均方根线宽下,实现了4.93 kW激光输出,中心波长为1067.5 nm,斜率效率为78%,光束质量为M~2<1.2。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Observations have shown that at the center of most galaxy there is a supermassive black hole of millions to billions solar masses,together with a large amount of stellar mass black holes. At the same time,evidence of the existence of intermediate-mass black holes is also emerging. Within hundreds of millions of years after the formation of the universe,some supermassive black holes reached tens of billions of solar masses. The formation and growth of these supermassive black holes is still a mystery. In the hierarchical structure model of galaxy formation,small galaxies are constantly merging to form larger and larger galaxies,and the black holes at the center of galaxies also undergo a process of merger and accretion,gradually forming supermassive black holes at different redshifts. This article summarizes the basic characteristics of black holes,current observation results,intermediate-mass black hole candidates, seed black holes,and the relationship between supermassive black holes and galaxies. The detection capability with the TianQin observatory is also evaluated. The analysis of the gravitational waves of these massive black hole binaries will greatly help us to understand the characteristics of massive black holes in the universe and the history of formation and evolution of supermassive black holes.","观测表明在正常星系和活动星系核中一般存在一个百万到数十亿太阳质量的超大质量黑洞和大量的恒星级质量黑洞。同时,中等质量黑洞存在的证据也初露端倪。在宇宙形成后的几亿年内,观测发现一些超大质量黑洞就达到了百亿个太阳质量,这些超大质量黑洞的形成和增长过程仍然是一个谜。在星系形成的等级结构模型中,小星系通过不断的并合形成越来越大的星系,其星系中心的黑洞也经历着并合和吸积过程,逐渐形成今天观测到的不同红移处的超大质量黑洞。本文主要对黑洞基本特征、当前主要观测结果、中等质量黑洞候选体、种子黑洞以及超大质量黑洞与星系关系等做一个简单的综述,并对天琴对宇宙中大质量双黑洞的探测能力进行评估。对于这些大质量双黑洞引力波的分析,将可以有效帮助我们认识宇宙中大质量黑洞的特性以及超大质量黑洞的形成和演化历史。"

On the theoretical side however, there remains a lot of unsolved mysteries in black hole physics. Of these, the information paradox is the most well-known. Nevertheless, there is another equally puzzling - if not more so - issue, which concerns the very heart of black holes: their singularities, where general relativity breaks down. What happens at the singularities of black holes? Can quantum gravity really remove black hole singularities? Is there a difference between Big Bang singularity and those inside black holes? More crucially, can singularities become naked, i.e. no longer shrouded by black hole horizon and therefore visible to ordinary observers?

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：We review the historical pursuits and recent developments on the origin of gravity. We start with the Newtonian gravity and Einstein gravity to introduce the two major leaps of the historical pursuits on the origin of gravity. Then we introduce the recent developments on the origin of gravity from the point of view of modified gravity, quantum gravity and holographic gravity. For Newtonian gravity, we start with Kepler's law on planetary motion to introduce the Newton's universal law of gravitation, and recent developments on the modified Newtonian dynamics and dark matter; for Einstein gravity, we explain the geometrization of gravity, and introduce the application of Einstein gravity on cosmology and gravitational waves; for modified gravity, we introduce it from the point of view of extra gravitational degrees of freedom, higher derivative gravity and higher dimensional gravity; for quantum gravity, we introduce it from the point of view of covariant quantum gravity, canonical quantum gravity and other scenarios of quantum gravity; for holographic gravity, we introduce its holographic picture, emergent properties and its connection with quantum information. However, the answer to the question of gravity origin still remains unknown. We point out here that three possible roads to approach the nature of gravity can be taken in future. The first one is the coming observations of gravitational waves from both ground-borne and space-borne gravitational-wave detectors. A system involving either black hole or neutron star has certainly run into the regime of strong gravity, which is quite different from previous tests for general relativity that is in the regime of weak gravity. The gravitational-wave observation will most likely provide us with clues on classical gravity with any possible deviations if Einstein gravity does modify itself at classical level. The second one is the understanding of the cosmic acceleration at both early-time and late-time. The cosmic acceleration at early-time is supposed to be driven by cosmic inflation, and the cosmic acceleration at late-time is supposed to be driven by the cosmological constant or alternatively dark energy. Future precise observations of radiation fluctuations and matter fluctuations will show us the way approach the nature of quantum gravity. The third one is the cognition of the relation of quantum gravity and quantum information. The past fifty years or so of pursuit on quantum gravity has leaded us to the path on the conjecture that quantum gravity might be emerged from quantum information. Although the perspective of this idea is not clear, it might be our best shot for now.","回顾了关于引力本质的历史探索和最新进展.从牛顿引力和爱因斯坦引力出发,介绍了关于引力本质历史探索上的两次重大飞跃.从修改引力、量子引力和全息引力三个方面,介绍了关于引力本质的最新进展.对于牛顿引力,从开普勒行星运动定律出发,介绍了牛顿万有引力定律.介绍了最近关于修改牛顿力学和暗物质的进展;对于爱因斯坦引力,阐释了引力的几何化,然后介绍了爱因斯坦引力在宇宙学和引力波方面的应用;对于修改引力,从额外的引力自由度、高阶导数引力和高维引力三个方面介绍;对于量子引力,从协变量子引力、正则量子引力和其他量子引力三个方面介绍;对于全息引力,介绍了它的全息图像、呈展性质以及它与量子信息之间的关系.但是截至目前,关于引力本质问题的答案依然是一个谜."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective With the success of ground-based gravitational wave detection, space-based gravitational wave detection has attracted wide attention from many research institutions around the world. The missions such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) initiated by NASA and ESA, New Gravitational Wave Observatory (NGO) initiated by ESA, and Tianqin program and Taiji program proposed by China, have high demands on the laser frequency noise at low Fourier frequencies between 0.1 mHz and 1 Hz. In order to fully meet the demands of those missions, the development of ultrastable lasers with higher frequency stability and coherence has never been suspended. Currently, the most popular way to achieve ultra-stable lasers is to stabilize the laser frequency onto a high-finesse Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity by using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) method. However, it requires fine alignment of free-space optical components and precise spatial mode matching, which dramatically increases the complexity and bulk of the system and is easily disturbed by the external environment. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements in the transportable applications of ultra-stable laser systems. In this article, an alternative approach is proposed, which uses an optical fiber-delay-line (FDL) as a frequency discriminator to stabilize the laser frequency. This approach has the advantages of high compactness, high reliability, small volume, and light weight, which make it a viable candidate for future laser-based gravitational wave detection missions. Methods The frequency stabilization of lasers is realized by using an unequal arm heterodyne Michelson fiber interferometer composed of an optical fiber delay line of 500 m. In order to reduce the influence of vibration noises on frequency-stabilized lasers, the optical fiber delay line of 500 m is precisely coiled on a low vibration sensitivity fiber spool. Then, the entire interferometer is placed in a small vacuum chamber, where all components such as an optical delay line of 500 m, single mode broadband coupler module (SMCM), and acoustic-optic modulator (AOM) are installed in a structurally stable thermal shielding system (Fig. 3). In addition, a two-stage active thermal controller is used to reduce the temperate fluctuation on the optical fiber interferometer. The first stage temperature stabilization is applied on the vacuum chamber with a temperature fluctuation of less than 5 mK over a 24 h period. The second stage temperature stabilization is applied on the fifth-layer thermal shield using thermoelectric coolers (TECs) mounted between the shield and the vacuum chamber, and the temperature fluctuation can be further minimized within 0.2 mK. Finally, by comparing with an independent ultra-stable laser of 1550 nm with better frequency stability via an optical frequency comb, the performance of the laser is measured. Results and Discussions The thermal time constant of the thermal shielding system is 6 h, and the temperature fluctuation of the inner fiber caused by the outermost thermal shielding can be suppressed to the original 4*10~(-7). For a temperature perturbation of 0.2 mK, the induced frequency instability of stabilized laser is 9*10~(-16). By comparing with another ultra-stable laser, the measured frequency noise power spectral density is lower than 30 Hz/Hz~(1/2) at Fourier frequencies from 30 mHz to 1 Hz (Fig. 6), in comparison with the pre-stabilization requirement for the LISA mission. The Allan variance of the beat note is also analyzed. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, the fractional frequency instability of 1.2*10~(-14) at averaging time of 1 s and that of 3*10~(-13) at averaging time of 1000 s are achieved. However, the result is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the calculated thermal effect.","基于未来卫星间激光干涉任务的需求,介绍了一种基于迈克耳孙光纤干涉仪稳频的1064 nm激光稳频系统,该系统采用全光纤器件,结构紧凑、体积小、可靠性强。通过拍频测试,得到该系统的频率噪声在30 mHz~1 Hz范围内小于30 Hz/Hz~(1/2),频率稳定度在积分时间为1 s和1000 s时分别为1.2*10~(-14)和3*10~(-13)。该系统的性能满足LISA任务对稳频激光的需求,有望应用于未来的空间引力波探测任务。"

When the laser light intensity of 1W was incident, the stray light intensity needs to be suppressed to less than 10 -10 W, otherwise the measurement accuracy of the main parameter optical path difference will be seriously affected. Aiming at the background of this application, the feasibility of Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters for mirror surface reflection characteristics reconstructed by stray light test data was considered when the thin beam incident on the mirror surface. In the traditional measurement of BRDF, four corners were required. The system was complex and inconvenient for real-time application. Based on the isotropic optical elements and the symmetry of mirror stray light model, considering the plane mirror, curved mirror and beam diffraction effect, measurement error and other factors, a method reconstructing the BRDF parameters by one-dimensional measurement the scattering of several points with the plane mirror rotation in the meridian plane was proposed, and the feasibility and measurement accuracy were verified by numerical methods.","激光引力波望远镜的杂散光来源主要是细光束入射到镜面产生的反射杂散光。1W的激光入射产生的杂散光需抑制到10-10W以下,否则将严重影响主要参数光程差的测量精度。针对该应用背景,考虑了在细光束入射到镜面条件下由杂散光测试数据重构表征镜面反射特性的双向反射分布函数(BRDF)参数的可行性。传统方法测量BRDF需要4个转角,系统复杂不便于实时应用。为此基于光学元件各向同性和镜面杂散光模型的对称性,综合考虑了平面镜、曲面镜以及光束衍射效应、测量误差等因素,提出了一种仅利用子午面内一维测量若干个点的散射数据即可重构得到BRDF参数的方法,并用数值方法对其可行性和测量精度进行了验证。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：After decades of development,the research of cosmology has entered the epoch of precision cosmology. According to the Planck observational results and the LambdaCDM model,we need only 6 parameters to reproduce the evolution history of the universe which is consistent with the observed data in a statistical sense. However,in fact,there are still many unsolved important scientific problems in the field of cosmology,and there will be some inconsistencies in different observational data when inferring cosmological parameters based on the basic LambdaCDM model. The answers to these questions require extension of the basic LambdaCDM model and accurately measurements of the additional parameters. At present,the mainstream cosmological probes are mainly optical(and near-infrared)observations of the expansion history and structural growth of the universe,so they may have similar systematic errors. It is very important for the future research of cosmology to develop new non-optical observational probes. Because the amplitude of gravitational wave carries the information of absolute luminosity distance,it can help us to establish the real distance-redshift relation and study the expansion history of the universe. This observation of gravitational waves is knownstandard siren. Cosmological research is one of the important research objectives of the Tianqin space gravitational wave detector,which is expected to be able to observe a large number of gravitational wave events in the future,providing valuable observational data for the study of cosmology(especially at high redshift). In this paper,we introduce previous researches about the ability of Tianqin standard siren data to constrain the cosmological parameters. We consider pop Ⅲ,Q3nod and Q3d models. The results show that for different binary models of massive black holes,the Tianqin project yields to different constraining results on the cosmological parameters,and the Q3nod model has the strongest ability. The standard siren detection of Tianqin is helpful to break the degeneracy of cosmological parameters caused by other observation methods,so as to effectively improve the measurement accuracy of cosmological parameters. We have reason to believe that the future gravitational wave observations combined with optical and radio observations will promote the exploration of the history of cosmic expansion to a new level,and provide help to detect the size of Hubble constant and reveal the nature of dark energy.","经过近几十年的发展,宇宙学的研究已经进入精确宇宙学时代。根据Planck测量结果和LambdaCDM模型,只需要6个参数就可以在统计意义上重现出与观测数据基本符合的宇宙演化历史。但是实际上,当前宇宙学领域中还存在许多未解决的重要科学问题,而且不同的观测数据在基于基本LambdaCDM模型进行宇宙学参数推断时会出现一些不一致性。这些问题的回答都需要对基本LambdaCDM模型进行扩展,并对额外引入的参数进行精确的测量。目前主流的宇宙学探针主要是针对宇宙的膨胀历史和宇宙的结构增长进行观测的光学(以及近红外)项目,因此它们可能存在着相似的系统误差。发展全新的非光学观测手段的宇宙学探针对于宇宙学未来的研究至关重要。因为引力波振幅携带了绝对光度距离的信息,所以能够帮助建立真正的距离红移关系,用以研究宇宙的膨胀历史。这种引力波观测被称为标准汽笛。宇宙学研究是天琴、LISA等空间引力波探测器的重要研究目标之一。这些探测器预计都可以在未来观测到大量的引力波事件,为宇宙学研究(特别是高红移宇宙)提供珍贵的观测数据。本文参考相关的文献,介绍了天琴标准汽笛数据限制宇宙学参数能力的情况。考虑了pop Ⅲ、Q3nod和Q3d三种大质量黑洞双星模型,结果表明,对于不同的大质量黑洞双星模型,天琴项目对宇宙学参数的限制能力各有不同,其中Q3nod模型下的限制能力最强。天琴的标准汽笛探测有助于打破其他观测手段所导致的宇宙学参数简并,从而有效地提升宇宙学参数的测量精度。我们有理由相信,未来的引力波观测与光学和射电观测相结合将把宇宙膨胀历史的探索推进至一个全新的层面,为探测哈勃常数大小、揭示暗能量的本质属性提供帮助。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Unlike their ground-based counterparts, space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection missions focus on the gravitational wave sources in the lower frequency band between 0.1 mHz and 1 Hz. Various gravitational wave sources in such a frequency band are believed to be of considerable interest in astronomy and cosmology. The typical gravitational wave sources of a space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna are the super (intermediate) mass black hole merger, extreme (intermediate) mass ratio in-spiral, galactic binaries of compact stars, and stochastic gravitational wave background. The gravitational wave sources within the 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band can help us understand the mystery of the universe's structural formation, evolution of massive black holes and its harbored galaxies, nature of gravity near the horizon of these massive black holes, and history of the early universe beyond the cosmic microwave background. To design a mission to achieve the abovementioned scientific impacts, considerable attention should be paid to several issues, such as orbital design and arm-length choice. The success of a space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection mission requires a pico-meter precision inter-satellite laser ranging interferometer system and a state-of-the-art drag-free control system because of the weakness of the gravitational wave signals. The inter-satellite laser ranging interferometer system comprises four subsystems: stable laser source, stable laser telescope, ultra-precise laser interferometer, and ultra-precise phasemeter. Techniques, such as arm-locking, time-delay interferometry, sideband scheme, differential wave-front sensing, and pointing control, should be employed to suppress the laser frequency noise, clock frequency noise, and laser pointing jitter noise. Additionally, the ultra-precise laser interferometer needs to integrate the following functionalities: laser acquisition, laser ranging, laser communication, and clock synchronization. Conversely, the drag-free control system has the following three components: inertial sensor, micro-thruster, and drag-free controller. The inertial sensor is used to sense the displacement between the spacecraft and proof mass and send the signal to the drag-free controller. Further, the controller commands the micro-thruster to push the spacecraft to maintain the proof mass' position centered at the electrostatic cage of the inertial sensor. The space laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna is also a highly complex system in debt of the high degree of coupling between a subsystem and the high confusion of the enormous quantity of signals. An end-to-end numerical simulator might be essential in helping us understand the problems of data analysis, optimization of the configuration of the spacecraft and payload, and optimization of the mission design to solve the problem caused by complexity and to enhance the scientific output. Additionally, a more careful investigation of the levels 1 and 2 data analyses investigating the scientific impacts of the gravitational wave sources is also needed. The key problems of the abovementioned space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection missions are generally discussed. Moreover, a brief history of the space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection missions, including LISA, which is the ESA-NASA joint space-borne gravitational wave antenna; Taiji, which is the space-borne gravitational wave mission proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences; and TianQin, which is a geocentric orbit space-borne gravitational wave mission raised by Sun Yat-sen University, is reviewed.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The space-based gravitational wave detection can acquire the gravitational wave source information with larger characteristic mass and scale, forming a complementary detection scheme with ground-based gravitational wave detection, primordial gravitational wave detection, and pulsar gravitational wave detection. The spacebased gravitational wave detection is based on a long-distance laser interference device, which mainly detects gravitational wave signals in a frequency range of 0.1 mHz-1 Hz. The noise evaluation and noise suppression of the laser light source system directly affect the detection sensitivity. In this work, based on low-noise photoelectric detection, a very low-frequency laser intensity noise test and evaluation system is constructed with high-precision digital multimeter, software control and algorithm programming of the host computer. The laser intensity noise can be converted into the fluctuation of the current signal by utilizing the photodiode, and the current signal is converted into the voltage signal and amplified by the transimpedance circuit. Thus the highfrequency interference components are filtered out by a passive low-pass filtering, and the extremely lowfrequency noise components are retained. According to the definition of shot noise, it can be known that the photocurrent injected into the detector is inversely proportional to the shot noise, so at least 5 mW laser is chosen for photoelectric detection. After controlling the high-precision digital multimeter through LabVIEW software programming, the acquisition is detected. The output voltage signal by the laser is subjected to the fast Fourier transform and logarithmic frequency axis power spectral density estimation algorithm for noise evaluation in the frequency domain, forming a complete laser intensity noise evaluation and measurement system.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The space-based gravitational wave detection frequency band is located in the range of 0.1 mHz-1 Hz, because the gravitational wave source information with larger characteristic quality and scale is contained in the aforementioned frequency band. At present, large-scale laser interferometer space-based gravitational wave detection projects based on different sizes and space orbits have been gradually implemented. It should be emphasized that the laser intensity noise and frequency noise should be suppressed in the laser source system of the interferometer. Moreover, as the first level device of laser noise characterization and suppression, the performance of photoelectric detection will directly affect the effect of laser noise suppression. First of all, on the basis of selecting low noise chip and high stable bias system, the whole circuit was designed by self-reducing circuit and transimpedance-amplifying circuit. In addition, in electromagnetic shielding, low temperature drift factor element, low noise power supply and active temperature control and other technical means, realize the development of high gain and low noise balanced homodyne detection system. Finally, the gain and bandwidth of the photodetector were evaluated and tested by combining the fast Fourier transform method and the number line power spectral density algorithm, and the intensity noise of the laser was detected and characterized in the 0.05 mHz-1 Hz band by using the detector. The experimental results show that the electronic noise spectral density of the balanced homodyne detector is less than 3.6*10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2) in the frequency range of 1 mHz-1 Hz, which is less than the noise requirement of the laser source for space-based gravitational wave detection.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective Space-based gravitational-wave observatories (SGOs) promise to measure pico-meter variations in the gigameter separations of a triangular constellation. Telescopes play a crucial role in using transmitting and receiving laser beams measuring the constellation arms with heterodyne laser interferometry. The far-field phase noise induced by the coupling of the wavefront aberrations of optical telescopes with their pointing jitters is one of the major noise sources for the measurement. As phase noise suppression is a critical aspect for achieving the required comprehensive measuring stability, this paper theoretically analyzes the mechanism of the far-field phase noise, proposes an optimization strategy for the design of the optical telescopes in SGOs, and verifies it to pave the way for the comprehensive phase noise control in the design-to-manufacture process. Methods To analytically establish the relationship of the coupling coefficient with the aberrations in the form of polynomial expansions, the paper adopts the Fringe Zernike polynomials to represent the aberrations and further construct and describe the wavefront error. Then, the coupling coefficient defined as the modulus of the gradient of the far-field wavefront error is expressed as a polynomial function of the aberration coefficients and the tilt angles and is further simplified on the basis of the symmetry of the telescope. According to this relationship and the aberration characteristics of the telescope design residuals, the paper evaluates the effect of different aberrations on phase noise, revealing that defocus, primary astigmatism, and primary spherical aberration are the keys to controlling the coupling coefficient. Thus, an optimization strategy based on key aberration control is proposed. The performance of this method in far-field phase noise suppression is verified by examples of telescope design. Results and Discussions The wavefront quality of the telescopes before and after optimization (Table 1) by the above strategy is at the lambda/20 (lambda =1064 nm) level. Before optimization, the far-field wavefront changes significantly within the range of 100 nrad. Accordingly, the coupling coefficient increases rapidly with the tilt angle to over 1 pm/nrad. After optimization, although the wavefront residuals are slightly worse (Table 2), the range of far-field wavefront error decreases markedly by more than 90% (Fig. 4). The corresponding coupling coefficient is smaller than 0.11 pm/nrad within the range of 100 nrad. It is only 6% of that before optimization and much smaller than the required value (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the optimization strategy based on aberration control can effectively reduce the coupling coefficient of the far-field phase noise, even in the case of poor wavefront quality. Conclusions On the basis of theoretical analysis of the mechanism of the far-field phase noise, this paper determines the relationship of the coupling coefficient with the aberrations, develops an optimization strategy based on key aberration control, and verifies the strategy. The results reveal that suppressing the key aberrations deliberately instead of simply enhancing the demand for wavefront quality in the optimization process can reduce the sensitivity of the far-field phase to jitters more efficiently, improve the far-field phase stability of the telescope significantly, and balance the severe noise budget and the design freedom of the telescope to reserve sufficient margin for the rest optics.","空间引力波望远镜的波像差与指向抖动耦合产生的远场相位噪声是引力波探测的主要噪声源。基于其产生的理论机制,建立了噪声耦合系数与望远镜像差间的函数关系,提出了控制特定像差的优化策略。结合望远镜设计实例验证了该方法对抑制远场相位噪声的效果,当波前质量水平为lambda/20(lambda =1064 nm)时,优化后的噪声耦合系数优于0.11 pm/nrad,较优化前降低了一个数量级,远优于指标要求,所提方法极大地提升了望远镜的远场相位稳定性。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective Combined with current testing technology and space-based gravitational wave detection requirements, relative intensity noise(RIN) testing must cover the frequency range of 0.1 mHz - 5 GHz. Currently, low-noise spectrum analyzer is used for RIN testing in the higher frequency band of 50 kHz-5 GHz, and relevant theories and testing methods are relatively mature. OEWaves of the USA SYCATUS of Japan and Shanghai Institute of Optical Machinery have launched corresponding standard test instruments. However, the current test methods in the low-frequency band are limited in the test band or have high background noise, which cannot fully meet the requirements of RIN low frequency band test and evaluation of laser light source for space-based gravitational wave detection. It is necessary to develop the low background noise measurement technology and complete and accurate evaluation standard of all low frequency band. Methods In this study, the low-frequency RIN within 0.1 mHz - 100 kHz is completely tested and characterized, and the background noise of the test system is reduced to form a standardized test system and test algorithm. First, based on low-noise photodetector, high-precision digital multimeter, Labview control data acquisition, and data processing algorithm programming, the test characterization of laser RIN in the frequency band of 0.1 mHz - 0.5 Hz was realized. In the time domain, the high-precision acquisition was conducted using the Labview software to control DMM. The fast Fourier transform(FFT) algorithm was used to analyze the noise characteristics of the collected data in the frequency domain. The smoothing function of different resolutions was used in the calculation of RIN to ensure that the test results in the low-frequency band are not true, while the serious trailing phenomenon in the high-frequency band was reduced. Besides, frequency domain analysis can be performed immediately upon the completion of the time domain collection, and the data can be stored in real time. Combined with the data of different sampling time, the accuracy of the very-low-frequency test results was verified. Second, FFT spectrum analyzer(SR770, Stanford Research Systems) was used to test the RIN of laser in the frequency band of 1 mHz- 100 kHz. By adding low noise amplifier(LNA) into the test system, the background noise in the frequency band of 1 mHz-1 Hz was effectively reduced. The testing capacity was reduced by 18 dB. Finally, the consistency of the test results of the two test methods in the overlapping frequency band was compared to verify the uniformity and accuracy of the two test results. Finally, the low-background-noise RIN test band was expanded to 0.1 mHz-100 kHz. The RIN noise measurement system has the advantages of wide coverage of low-frequency band, high precision, and high accuracy. It can provide a standardized measurement means for the relative intensity noise of laser in space gravitational wave detection and can also be applied to other low-frequency precision measurement applications of laser light source noise assessment. Results and Discussions According to the sampling time listed in Table 3, data segments ranging from 10000 s to 8000 s are captured to calculate the laser very-low-frequency RIN, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the highfrequency tail after Smooth piecewise smoothing algorithm is only 2 dB; in the range of 0.04 Hz to 0.5 Hz, different data lengths have little influence on RIN results.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective Currently,high-reflectivity optical elements are widely used in optical fields,such as ring laser gyroscopes,inertial confinement fusion systems,and gravitational wave detection.Their reflectivity values have a decisive influence on the performance improvement of these systems;therefore,accurate measurement of their reflectivity values is necessary to optimize the system performance.At present,there are many measurement methods,among which spectrophotometry and cavity ring-down (CRD) technology are the most widely used.However,these two methods have certain shortcomings.Spectrophotometry is associated with low accuracy,and its measurement limit is usually lower than 99.9%;especially when measuring high reflectivity (>99%),its accuracy is reduced.Devices using CRD technology for high reflectivity measurement are relatively complex and expensive,and the measurement conditions,such as adjusting the incident angle and polarization state,are inflexible.Moreover,according to the measurement principle,the lower the reflectivity of the sample to be measured,the lower is the measurement accuracy.Therefore,for samples with the reflectivity of 99.9%-99.99%,existing testing methods have some limitations.Based on the described situation,it is necessary to study a high-precision reflectivity measuring device that can measure the reflectivity of 99.9%-99.99% accurately.It is necessary to develop a reflectivity measuring device which has the advantages of simple device,convenient adjustment and good measurement stability.Methods Based on traditional spectrophotometry,we study a more accurate reflectivity measurement method.The main improvement in this method is measuring the difference signal instead of the reflected light and incident light signal.In this study,a reflectance measuring device based on spectrophotometry is developed,which adopts a double-path measurement.First,we measure the signal difference between the reference optical path and the initial optical path without samples,and the reference optical path signal (Fig.2).We then measure the signal difference between the reference optical path and the test optical path after placing the sample (Fig.3).The reflectivity of the sample is calculated according to the measured reference and differential signals.The reflectivity is calculated by measuring the difference between the reference signal and the initial signal and the difference between the reference signal and the test signal.Compared with the reference signal,initial signal,and test signal with larger absolute values,the signal difference itself is relatively small;therefore,the sensitivity of the lock-in amplifier can be fully utilized to improve the reflectivity measurement accuracy.In addition,we use a quick fixing mechanism to shorten the measurement time and reduce the influence of unstable factors such as the light source and environment on the experimental results.In the experiment,there are some differences in the responses of the detectors' photosensitive devices at different positions;therefore,mobile platforms are installed at the three positions where the two detectors are placed.Before the formal measurement,the position of the detector is adjusted to ensure that the beam irradiates the position where the conversion efficiency is the highest on the receiving surface of the detector.Results and Discussions We use this device and the CRD method to test the highly reflective mirror samples.The wavelength in the two methods is 1064 nm,and the incident angle is 45°.The high-reflection wavelength of the two high-reflection mirror samples is 1064 nm,the use angle is 45°,the lens diameter is 50 mm,and the thickness is 5 mm.The two samples are measured using Spolarized light and P-polarized light,respectively,and the highest reflectivity is 99.986% (Table 1).In this study,the error is calculated using an uncertainty transfer formula.","目前,高反射率反射镜在激光陀螺和引力波探测等领域中有着广泛的应用。但对于反射率为99.9%~ 99.99%的样品,现有测试手段存在一定局限性。搭建了基于分光光度法的反射率测量装置,采用双光路测量方法,通过测量参考信号和基准信号、参考信号和测试信号的差分信号来计算反射率。与绝对值较大的参考信号、基准信号和测试信号等相比,信号差值本身相对较小,因此可以充分利用锁相放大器的灵敏度来提高反射率的测量精确度。所介绍的测量方法的精确度可达10~(-5),与光腔衰荡法进行对比,测量误差在0.009%以下。所提方法用简单的装置就能达到较高的精确度,满足99.9%~99.99%反射率的精确测量需求。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The gravitational scattering from foreground large-scale structures to the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons distorts the linear polarization pattern,converting E-mode into B-mode polarization.The resulting signal is referred to as Lensing-B mode,which strongly contaminates measurements of the primordial B-mode produced by primordial gravitational waves.To measure the primordial B-mode with a high degree of precision,we must subtract the Lensing-B mode at the map level.This operation is called delensing.The Ali CMB polarization telescope 1st-phase project (AliCPT-1) is the first ground-based cosmological millimeter survey in the northern hemisphere.This article forecasts AliCPT-1's lensing reconstruction and delensing capacity based on simulated data over five seasons.A signal-to-noise ratio of 13.4 can be achieved for lensing reconstruction.Two methods were employed for delensing:the internal and external methods.The former relies solely on CMB data,while the latter requires cosmic infrared background data.Furthermore,we find that the delensing efficiency of the internal method is lower than that of the external method.The maximum delensing efficiency for the internal method peaks at the spherical harmonic mode ? = 50 with an amplitude of 10%,whereas that of the external method peaks at ? ? 200 with an amplitude of 20%.The external delensing method could improve the measured value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio from r ≤ 0.03 to r ≤ 0.02.","前景大尺度物质密度结构会通过引力相互作用产生对原初宇宙微波背景(CMB)光子偏振模式的畸变,将一部分CMB的E模偏振转化为B模偏振.该效应产生的B模偏振信号被称为透镜B模.透镜B模会对由原初引力波产生的原初B模偏振信号产生强烈的污染.为了探测微弱的原初B模信号,我们需要在天图层面上对透镜B模进行扣除,该操作被称为去透镜.阿里原初引力波探测计划1期(AliCPT-1)是国际上首个位于北半球的地基毫米波宇宙学巡天观测计划.本文基于5个观测季的模拟数据分析了AliCPT-1的透镜重构和去透镜能力.对于透镜重构,我们发现透镜重构的信噪比可以达到SNR=13.4.对于去透镜,我们采用了只依赖CMB数据的内部和需要引入宇宙红外背景数据的外部两种不同的去透镜方案.我们发现,内部去透镜方案在球谐多极矩? = 200处的去透镜效率最高,约为10%;而外部去透镜方案则更为有效,最大去透镜效率出现在? ? 100处,约为23%.利用外部去透镜方案,有望将对张标比的测量精度由r≤0.03降至≤0.02."

The detection of such signals will contribute to further research on BH physics and enhance our understanding of BH populations. However, such a GW source has not yet been detected and has not been widely considered in the current study. Therefore, it is important to research its detectability. Based on the numerical relativistic simulation, a recent study has given accurate waveforms for parabolic BH encounters. Using the GW burst search tool Minke, a large-scale data set is produced in the two-parameter spaces of total mass and distance, and the detection range was quantitatively calculated. The result shows that BH encounter is a potential candidate for current groundbased detectors. Finally, a focus question that how to distinguish the BH capture from a binary BH merger is discussed. Using the posterior distributions of the signal under the two samplers, a distinguishing method is proposed. By comparing different posteriors, it is found that there is a significant difference in the merger time t0 of the BH capture and binary BH merger signal, which contributes to distinguishing the two GW sources.","球状星团和星系核中拥有非常密集的恒星质量黑洞,当两个黑洞相互靠近时,会形成偏心率极高的轨道并发射引力波。该类信号的探测将有助于黑洞物理的进一步研究,加强对黑洞种群的理解。然而,这类引力波尚未被探测到,在当前的研究里没有被广泛考虑。因此,研究它的可探测性是重要的。根据数值相对论模拟,最近的研究给出了抛物线黑洞交会的准确波形。利用引力波搜索工具Minke,在总质量和距离两个参数空间里制作了大规模的数据集,并定量计算了探测范围。结果表明,黑洞交会产生的引力波很可能是当前地基探测器的潜在探测对象,同时,下一代引力波探测器明显扩大了探测范围。最后讨论了如何判断并合信号为黑洞俘获的热点问题。利用信号在两种采样器下的后验分布,提出了一种区分方法。通过比较不同的后验,发现双黑洞并合与黑洞俘获信号在并合时间t0上存在显著差异,这将有助于在并合样本中区分这两种波源。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The hot big bang cosmology is very successful, and the Hubble law, the cosmic microwave background radiation and the abundance of light elements etc. predicted by the hot big bang model have been confirmed by a plenty of cosmological observations. However, the hot big bang model still suffers from several puzzles, such as the flatness problem, the horizon problem, the unwanted relics and so on. The inflation model which was proposed by Alan Guth in the early of 1980s is an elegant paradigm which provides a simple solution to all of the problems in the hot big bang model. Due to the nearly exponential expansion of space during inflation, the initial spatial curvature and inhomogeneities are smoothed away. In this sense, a spatially flat universe can be taken as one of the key predictions of inflationary universe and it has been confirmed by a lot of cosmological observations. On the other hand, during inflation, the Universe is small and the quantum effects become significant. Actually, such quantum fluctuations will finally seed the formation of large-scale structure and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Because the Hubble parameter is roughly a constant during inflation, the power spectrum of the density perturbation generated by the quantum fluctuations is expected to be nearly scale-invariant. Actually, all of the current cosmological observations really prefer a Gaussian and nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum of density perturbations which is nicely consistent with the prediction of the simple inflation models. In addition, inflation also predicts that there should be primordial gravitational waves which generate the B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background. In the early of 2014, BICEP2 collaborations reported an excess of B-mode power over the based lensed standard cosmological model expectation at the cosmic scales. Unfortunately, it is finally confirmed to be the foreground contaminations, not originated from the primordial gravitational waves. Up to now, ones only set a restricted upper limit on the amplitude of primordial gravitational-wave power spectrum. Such a small upper limit implies that the inflation is driven by an effective cosmological constant at the leading order. In order for naturally ending inflation at a time in the early universe, there should be a dynamical term in the potential of inflation field as well. The precise measurement of the spectral index of scalar power spectrum from Planck satellite favors the so-called Starobinsky's inflation model which is driven by the R2 term adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, why the higher order corrections should be exponentially suppressed in the Starobinsky's inflation model is still an open question. In addition, if a contraction phase happened before the inflation, it may modify the primordial density perturbation power spectrum at very large scales and may help us to explain some hints of the anomalies on such scales.","热大爆炸宇宙学取得巨大的成功,它所预言的哈勃定律、宇宙微波背景辐射和轻元素丰度等都得到了观测的广泛证实.但是热大爆炸宇宙理论自身有着无法解释的疑难问题,比如宇宙空间平坦性问题、视界问题等.为了解决热大爆炸宇宙学的诸多疑难问题,一个最简单经济的方案是在宇宙热大爆炸前发生一段由真空能推动的宇宙近指数膨胀的宇宙演化过程,即宇宙暴胀.事实上,发生在宇宙极早期的暴胀过程不仅可以合理地解释所有这些热大爆炸宇宙学中的疑难问题,而且起源于暴胀期间的量子扰动自然地提供了宇宙晚期结构形成所需的原初密度涨落.反过来,探测宇宙微波背景辐射微小的各向异性和宇宙结构成了探索早期宇宙暴胀物理过程的关键手段.尽管现有的大量宇宙学观测强有力地支持暴胀宇宙学,然而当前在宇宙大尺度上似乎依然存在一些偏离标准暴胀宇宙学预言的迹象,这些迹象可能暗示宇宙在极早期暴胀前还经历了一段收缩过程."

Gravitational waves will provide us with a powerful tool for investigating the physics of BBHs, because it encodes information about the formation channel of this system. However, Many physical properties of BBH system is still unknown, especially mass, spin and other intrinsic parameter distributions of binary system from different formation channels. Mass distribution of black holes from gravitational-wave detection and X-ray observation are different, because of different formational channels. X-ray observation indicates that the black hole mass distribute mainly in (7.8 1.2)M_⊙, which may come from dynamical capture. And mass estimation from gravitational waves is in the range 20M_⊙ 40M_⊙, which is supposed to be field BBHs. This is because Jeans stability analysis provides corresponding Jeans radius and black hole mass which is smaller than dynamical binaries. Two formation channels are commonly considered for BBH coalescence: common envelope evolution and dynamical evolution mechanism which have the underlying uncertain intrinsic parameter distributions on mass and spin. The two formation channels have different mass and spin distributions, and due to Jeans stability analysis, black hole mass from common envelope evolution is smaller than the other case and spin aligned. BBHs from dynamical capture mechanism have random oriented spins commonly considered as isotropic distribution. Based on differences especially mass and spin distributions of BBHs from the two formation channels, using Bayesian hierarchical inference to distinguish the two formation channels is workable, more over, Bayes method can be used to calculate relative population of sources in each channel.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：KAGRA is the Japanese kilometer-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detector. It is currently in the commissioning stage and it will soon join LIGO and Virgo for the detection of gravitational waves. Adding KAGRA to the detectors network will increase the sky location accuracy of the gravitational wave source. The several special techniques used in KAGRA will generate new experience. The underground location of the detector will reduce the seismic noise and cryogenic operation will reduce the thermal noise. As a future upgrade of the ground-based gravitational wave interferometric detectors, the laser power and the mirror mass will increase. In this condition, the quantum noise will limit the sensitivity in all the detection frequency range. To reduce quantum noise in the next generation gravitational wave detectors, one of the most well-known quantum non-demolition techniques is the so-called frequency dependent squeezing. The application of this technique consists on the injection of a 9 dB squeezed vacuum, filtered by a 300 m long cavity with 80 ppm of round trip loss. Rotating the squeezing angle by using the filter cavity has been demonstrated in the MHz range with a 0.5 m long cavity [13] and in the kHz range with a 2 m long cavity [14] . In this article we briefly introduce the theory of this technique and, based on the design of KAGRA, we calculate a factor of 2 improvements on the design sensitivity. We present the latest progresses on the experiment currently ongoing in the laboratory of NAOJ, where we are aiming to demonstrate the theoretical prediction of quantum noise suppression. The south arm of the old TAMA300 detector is used as the filter cavity, which is the first 100 m scale filter cavity and the longest in the world.","随着技术的发展,下一代引力波探测器的激光功率将得到进一步提高。大光斑半径的应用也将使探测器的热噪声进一步降低,因此,量子噪声将成为在全频段限制引力波探测器灵敏度的首要因素。作为目前最有保障的一种降低量子噪声的技术,频率相关压缩态很可能将被应用于下一代所有引力波探测器中。频率相关压缩态可以通过将频率不相关压缩态与滤波腔相结合而产生。基于滤波腔具有的频率响应特性,这一技术的应用可以使低频波段的辐射压噪声有效降低,同时实现高频波段散粒噪声的降低,从而实现全探测频段灵敏度的提升。基于日本KAGRA引力波探测器的设计,我们预计将9 dB压缩度的压缩态与周损失为8 * 10~(-5)的300 m滤波腔相结合,可以使探测器灵敏度在全探测频段提高1倍。此实验于2015年开始,目前滤波腔的安装调试已经基本完成,得到的结果基本与实验前的模拟相符合。与频率不相关压缩态光学实验台的安装过程也已经过半,通过温度和控制回路的调制,二次谐波腔的转化率已经超过50%。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective The space-based gravitational wave detection mission needs to realize the construction of ultra-long distance (3*10~6 km)laser link between two satellites through the laser acquisition and pointing system, and realize the capture precision of 1 murad and the pointing jitter control of 10 nrad/ Hz at 1 mHz- 1 Hz. The laser power becomes very small after being transmitted over millions of kilometers. Ultra-long distance, ultra-low power and high precision requirements make the laser link construction process of Taiji program a great challenge. In order to realize the networking of three satellites, the whole laser link construction process needs to establish three bidirectional laser links in turn. Space-based gravitational wave detection proposes a scheme to gradually build a bidirectional laser link by using three-level detectors of star tracker (STR), complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)capture camera and quadrant photodiode (QPD), and finally realize the ultra-stable laser pointing jitter control through the highprecision attitude information measured by the differential wavefront sensing (DWS)technology. At present, the scheme is in the stage of theoretical demonstration. In order to test the scheme, we adopt the laboratory's laser acquisition and pointing integrated optical system and a card based on a ZYNQ chip, and expect to realize autonomous control of the whole laser link construction process. Methods We use ground optical experiment to simulate the actual laser link construction progress between two satellites under the laboratory conditions. The whole experiment includes two optical benches which are actually realistic restoration of Taiji program acquisition and pointing light path (Fig. 3), and they are respectively mounted on two hexapod displacement tables to simulate the adjustment of satellite attitude. To fully simulate the whole progress of the actual laser link construction, the ground optical experiment is divided into four stages: initialization, coarse acquisition, fine acquisition and laser pointing. According to the scheme of laser link construction, we design the whole progress flow control, spiral scanning control, spot centroid location and closed-loop control by Verilog, and verify every module separately. And then we use ZYNQ card to control the whole experiment. Results and Discussions The experimental results show that the bidirectional laser link is successfully constructed in the atmospheric environment. Finally, corresponding to the wavefront of the actual system's telescope, the acquisition precision reaches 0.07 murad and the control accuracy of the final laser pointing control process reaches 9.7 nrad/ Hz in the sensitive frequency band of the Taiji program, which can meet the task requirements. The main influencing factors of the spot centroid control effect in the fine acquisition stage are the calibration error during the DWS calibration and the position error caused by the long-term drift of the manual four-axis displacement table. The internal stress change of the manual four-axis displacement table results in a large difference between the actual displacement table position and the position calibrated before the experiment in the pitch and yaw directions, which causes the position of the spot centroid during the experiment to deviate from the zero point of the hexapod displacement table. And the main factor affecting the control accuracy during the laser pointing stage is the background noise. By collecting the DWS data without controlling the hexapod displacement table when the platforms are aligned, it is found that the laser pointing precision is close to the background noise level (Fig. 13). Therefore, the background noise is the main noise source, which includes atmospheric fluctuation, temperature shift and environmental vibration.","太极计划需要通过激光捕获指向系统实现两颗卫星之间超长距离(3*10~6 km)的激光链路构建,并且实现1 murad的捕获精度以及10 nrad/ Hz(1 mHz~1 Hz)的指向抖动控制精度。空间引力波探测提出利用星敏感器(STR)、互补金属氧化物半导体(CMOS)捕获相机以及四象限光电探测器(QPD)等三级探测器逐步构建双向激光链路的方案,并最终通过差分波前传感技术(DWS)测量的高精度姿态信息来实现超稳的激光指向抖动控制。目前该方案仍处于理论论证阶段。为了测试该方案,采用实验室现有激光捕获指向一体化的光学系统以及一块ZYNQ芯片的自研板卡,尝试实现整个激光链路构建过程的全自主控制流程。实验结果表明:在大气环境下,成功自主完成了双向激光链路的构建,最终对应到实际系统望远镜前的捕获精度达到了0.07 murad,指向控制过程的控制精度在太极计划的敏感频段内达到了9.7 nrad/ Hz,能够满足任务需求。实验成功验证了激光链路构建方案的可行性,为下一步太极计划激光链路构建控制系统工程实施阶段的板级实现奠定了基础。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective To detect low-frequency gravitational waves, it is necessary to eliminate the interference of geo-noise and build a laser interference gravitational wave detection device in space. Taiji, LISA, Tianqin and other space gravitational wave detection missions have been planning to achieve pm-sensitivity on the arm length of several million kilometers to meet the requirements of gravitational wave detection. Because of orbit evolution and time delay in the interferometer arms, the direction of transmitted laser beam changes, consequently, a remote telescope cannot receive the laser beam to complete the inter-satellite laser interference. Aiming at the need for the point ahead angle of the emission beam, a beam pointing mechanism that provides the point ahead angle in the laser interference link is designed and developed for the space gravitational wave detection device, called the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism. Methods Based on the design concept of aligning the rotary axis on the mirror surface, the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism employs the structural form of flexible hinges and lever (Fig.2), and the control scheme of piezoelectric ceramic self-closing loops to achieve one-dimensional high-precision beam rotation (Fig.3). Mechanical properties are verified by the simulation analysis (Fig.4-5). Rotary range of the mechanism is verified by the simulation analysis (Fig.6). Under the condition of normal temperature and pressure with a relative humidity of 60%, the rotary characteristic test is carried out by using an autocollimator (Fig.7). And under the conditions of normal temperature (24 ℃) and vacuum environment (less than 50 Pa), a special interferometer is built to test the optical path difference (Fig.9). Results and Discussions A series of experiments are conducted on the mechanism, and the results show that the rotary range of the mechanism is 709.4 murad, rotary accuracy is 0.44 murad, and the results meet the requirements (Fig.8). The optical path differences are better than 10 pm/Hz when the frequency is between 1 Hz and 10 Hz, and the results meet the requirement (Fig.10). But when the frequency was between 1 mHz and 1 Hz, the optical path differences are greater than 10 pm/Hz. After simulation analysis, they are mainly related to the influence of temperature changes in the experimental environment (Fig.11). This is also the direction of further research. In short, it is proven that the principal design of the mechanism is feasible, and it is a reasonable reference for achieving ultra-stable and high-precision beam rotation. Conclusions In this study, the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism for space gravitational wave detection is designed and developed, and the corresponding index tests are completed, which verify the rationality of the mechanism design. The mechanism is a one-dimensional and two-way rotation, the maximum rotary range can reach about 709.4 murad, and the rotary accuracy can reach about 0.44 murad, all of which meet the expected design requirements. When the frequency is between 1 Hz and 10 Hz, the optical path difference caused by the mechanism is better than 10 pm/Hz, and when the frequency is between 1 mHz and 1 Hz, the optical path difference is greater than 10 pm/Hz. The optical path difference of the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism developed in this paper still has a gap with the foreign advanced level and design requirements, and the mechanism needs to be optimized. At the same time, the influence of temperature on the optical path difference test should be considered in further research.","探测低频引力波需要脱离地缘噪声干扰,在空间搭建激光干涉引力波探测装置。太极、 LISA、天琴等空间引力波探测任务,计划在几十万到几百万公里量级的臂长上实现皮米级的位移测量精度,以满足引力波探测的要求。在探测任务中,考虑轨道季节性变化和星间激光传输时间等因素,发射光束需要一个超前角度,确保远端望远镜能够接收到光束,从而完成星间激光干涉。针对发射光束需要超前角度的需求,设计并研制了一款用于激光干涉链路中提供超前角度的光束指向机构,即超前瞄准机构。该机构基于将偏转轴配置在反射镜面上的设计理念,采用柔性铰链和杠杆配合的结构形式,利用压电陶瓷自闭环进行驱动控制,实现光束一维高精度偏转。对该机构进行仿真分析,验证其力学特性以及偏转范围。对所研制的机构进行了一系列实验测试,结果表明,该机构偏转范围可达到709.4 murad,偏转精度可达到0.44 murad,机构偏转引起的光程差优于10 pm/Hz (1~10 Hz)。从而验证了该机构设计的可行性,为实现光束超稳高精度偏转提供一定的参考。"
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：We aim to study the effects of chemical potential and angular velocity on the critical endpoint of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We used several probes (drag force, jet quenching parameter, heavy vector meson spectral function) to characterize the phase transition and studied gravitational waves from the holographic QCD phase transition in the early universe. We used different holographic QCD models to discuss the QCD phase transition, energy loss, spectral function, and gravitational waves. We found that the chemical potential and angular velocity changed the location of the critical endpoint, and the drag force and jet quenching parameter were temperature dependent and enhanced near the phase transition temperature. The magnetic field had a nontrivial effect on the spectral function. We conclude that the chemical potential decreases omega_c, and the angular velocity decreases mu_c and the phase transition temperature. The jet quenching parameter and drag force can characterize the phase transition, and the magnetic field promotes the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the energy density of gravitational waves decreases as the gluon condensate increases, and the peak frequency shifts downward with increasing gluon condensate. Exploring the phase structure of QCD is an important task in high-energy heavy ion collision physics, and recently, there has been considerable interest in the QCD phase transition for rotating backgrounds.","探寻量子色动力学(Quantum Chromodynamics,QCD)相结构一直是高能重离子碰撞物理研究的重要目标。近年来,转动背景下的QCD相变引起了研究者们的关注。本文基于AdS/QCD对偶,研究了化学势、角速度对QCD临界点的影响。研究发现:化学势减小了临界转速omega_c,角速度降低了mu_c和相变温度。我们通过计算一些可以表征QCD相变的探针,如拖曳力、扩散系数、喷注淬火参数和J/psi的谱函数,发现喷注淬火参数和拖曳力在相变温度附近有增强,峰值所对应的温度随着化学势的增加降低,这与相图中相变温度随化学势增加而降低相对应。谱函数的结果表明,磁场促进重介子的溶解,使末态J/psi产额的压低更明显。我们研究了早期宇宙QCD全息相变产生的引力波,发现胶子凝聚抑制了引力波的能量密度,峰值频率位置随着胶子凝聚增加而下降。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective The balanced homodyne detector (BHD) is widely used in quantum noise measurement, gravitational wave detection, high-sensitivity interferometric timing measurement, continuous-variable quantum key distribution, and quantum random number generation. Highly sensitive to the amplitude and phase of the incident light, the BHD can reliably extract quantum fluctuations, suppress the classical common-mode noise, and amplify quantum fluctuations to the macro level. However, the performance of the BHD is limited by the bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the detector. The optimal design of the BHD has always been a research hotspot. The transimpedance circuit based on a direct current (DC) coupled circuit is not suitable for detecting quantum noise. The reason is that as the power of the incident light increases, the unbalanced DC increases rapidly, and the transimpedance amplifier is saturated, which significantly reduces the dynamic range of the BHD. The BHD based on an inductor-capacitor (L-C) coupled circuit generates higher electronic noise at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. It is not suitable for low-frequency measurements due to the parasitic effect of the inductor and the low impedance of the inductor at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. In this paper, the noise sources of the BHD are analyzed theoretically, and a resistor-capacitor (R-C) coupled transimpedance circuit is used to improve the performance of the BHD at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. Furthermore, the transimpedance circuit is optimized to increase the bandwidth to 200 MHz. The CMRR of the BHD is improved by designing a self-subtraction photodetector scheme, a variable optical attenuator, and an adjustable reverse bias voltage. These designs allow the BHD to meet the low-frequency and highfrequency measurements with high SNR and CMRR in quantum noise measurement. Methods To enable the BHD to measure both low-frequency and high-frequency signals with high sensitivity, this paper adopts the BHD based on an R-C coupled transimpedance circuit. Two photodiodes are connected in series, and the balanced current signal in the two photodiodes is divided into a DC signal and an alternating current (AC) signal by the R-C coupled structure. The AC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and is further used to measure the shot-noise power of the incident light. The DC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a load resistor and is then used to measure the balance between the two incident lights. To reduce the crosstalk between the DC circuit and the AC circuit, an isolation amplifier is added after the load resistor. An adjustable bias voltage (BV) circuit is used to adjust the junction capacitance of the photodiodes and further improve the CMRR. To compensate for the difference in the amplitude of the two photodiodes and thereby improve the CMRR of the BHD, the paper also utilizes a variable optical attenuator based on fiber bending, where variable attenuation is achieved by changing the radius of the bent fiber. The attenuation of the fiber is precisely adjusted to balance the photocurrent. In addition, an equivalent noise model is constructed. The electronic noise from the TIA circuit includes four parts, i. e., the noise introduced by the dark current in the photodiodes, the thermal noise in the feedback resistor, the noise generated by the input current noise in the TIA, and the noise produced by the input voltage noise. On the basis of theoretical analysis, reasonable DC load resistance and feedback capacitance, photodiodes with low dark current and low junction capacitance, and a TIA with low input noise are selected to reduce the electronic noise and improve the SNR of the BHD.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The high sensitivity of gravitational wave detection provides a new way to explore the universe.Gravitational wave detection is a field of modern physics that has gained significant importance.The primary focus of space gravitational wave detection is to capture gravitational wave signals in the frequency range of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz,which are mainly released by double compact star systems and astronomical events such as the merger of double black hole celestial bodies with a maximum mass ratio.This detection method complements ground-based gravitational wave and primary gravitational wave detection techniques.Space gravitational wave detection primarily relies on the establishment of a high-precision space inertial reference load ultra-stable platform across multiple satellites and high-precision inter-satellite laser interferometry technology as its core,including the tow-free control technology,ultra-high-precision inter-satellite laser interferometry technology,ultra-high sensitivity inertial sensing technology,precision formation technology,micro-new micro-push technology,and more.The laser source noise of spaceborne laser systems directly affects the sensitivity of ultra-high precision inter-satellite laser interferometry technology.Therefore,it is necessary to suppress laser intensity noise.Low noise laser source is essential to build a large-scale laser interferometer device for both space and ground-based gravitational wave detection.With suppressing the noise of the laser source by photoelectric feedback,the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detection device is improved.In the photoelectric feedback loop,the signal detected by the photodetector is first subtracted from the signal of voltage reference source,after passing through the proportional integral differentiator,it is then fed back to the pump photocurrent to suppress the noise of the laser source.During the feedback process,the photoelectric detection is the first stage to acquire the signal,the noise level of the photodetector will directly affect the performance of subsequent feedback loop.To improve the accuracy of the detection and level of the noise suppressing,the electronic noise of the photodetector must be restrained while the detection range must be expanded.To deal with the problems mentioned above,the photodetector with low noise is finally designed by choosing low noise voltage reference chip,low dark current photodiode,using low temperature drift factor element,designing transimpedance amplifiers circuit together with precise temperature controlling and electromagnetic shielding.Photodiodes need to be loaded with appropriate reverse bias for photoelectric conversion.The voltage stability of the reverse bias will directly affect the stability of photoelectric conversion in the photodiode,thus affecting the electronic noise of the photoelectric detection system.At the same time,the electronic noise of the photodetector is measured using a low noise power supply without a light source,and the electronic noise of the detector is tested using a high-precision multimeter.The performance of the designed photodetector is evaluated with the low frequency intensity noise evaluation system.The results show that the electronic noise spectral density of the detector is less than 1.649*10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2),1.649* 10~(-5) V/Hz1/2 at 0.1 mHz,6.95*10~(-6) V/Hz~(1/2) at 1 mHz,7.07*10~(-8) V/Hz~(1/2) at 1 Hz at the frequency of the space gravitational wave band.The gain of the photodetector is 40 dB with 8 mW laser injecting into the photodiode.The performance of the designed photodetector satisfies the requirement of laser noise suppressing for gravitational wave detection.","通过选定低噪声电压基准芯片作为光电二极管的稳定偏压,采用低暗电流光电二极管,设计外围跨阻放大电路,利用低温漂系数元件,温控及电磁屏蔽等,研发低噪声光电探测器,并通过低频段强度噪声评估系统对其噪声进行测试评估。实验结果表明:所研发的低噪声探测器在空间引力波频段的电子学噪声谱密度在1.649*10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2)以下,在0.1 mHz处为1.649*10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2),在1 mHz处为6.95*10~(-6) V/Hz~(1/2),在1 Hz处为7.07*10~(-8) V/Hz~(1/2);在8 mW激光入射光电二极管时,探测器抬高为40 dB。该探测器噪声性能均小于相应引力波探测中对激光强度噪声的要求,可为引力波探测中激光强度噪声抑制等方面提供关键器件支撑。"

Many related studies have been carried out at home and abroad. But,it is still difficult to balance heavy loads with high accuracy. In this article,we propose a measurement method based on parallelogram mechanism and build a thrust measurement device to address the problem of difficult thrust measurement of small thrust-to-weight ratio thrusters. It has advantages of high load carrying capacity,high accuracy and good stability. The parallelogram mechanism acts as both a thruster load-bearing component and an elastic element that converts the thrust into a single-degree-of-freedom linear displacement. The micro-displacement is measured by a laser interferometer. Then,the force value to be measured is calculated based on the Hooke's law. The mechanical response of the device is tested by using electromagnetic force. Experimental results show that the minimum force value that can be resolved by the measurement system is 17.2 muN with a range of 17.2~ 2 789.9 muN and a relative uncertainty of 1.26% at an actual load-bearing capacity of 2.5 kg.

A null-type pendulum is developed to measure the response time of micro thrust in the paper, based on feedback control on pulse width modulation (PWM) of electrostatic fins (ESF). The displacement sensor, micro-controller and ESF are connected in a close-loop tuned by proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Constraining the pendulum within a small deflection, the force exerted by ESF equals the thrust loaded by solenoid as a replacement of micro-thrusters. The PWM linearizes the relation-ship between excitation voltage and its thrust response and simplifies the calibration of a second order system after a z-domain fit of the transfer function. The experiments showed the deadtime of the null balance is less than 4 ms by template matching in a 2 Hz sine disturbance, and the rise time of 25 N step response is about 98 ms. Besides, the paper also focuses on several key prob-lems, which involved in the robust control of the second order system plus dead time, the vital high frequency noise to derivative term, the resolution boundaries to discriminate the low frequency balances noise from the thrusts, the asymmetry buried in the null-balance using unilateral actuators, the uncertainties of response time in the magnitude and initial phase of thrust, as well as the difference in performance during the application of real thrusters.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Gravitational waves are an important prediction of general relativity, made in 1916 by Einstein. Yet, the deformation that they imprint on space has never been observeddirectly. The first such observation should soon be made with pulsar timing arrays or large laser interferometers, which are emphasized in this paper. The advanced interferometers will be fully operational in a few years. We review many important data analysis techniques used for these instruments.In the same way as the exploration of the electromagnetic spectrum opened new windows on the universe (radio waves, infrared, visible spectrum,ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.), the ability to sense gravitational waves will open a new kind of astronomy. Infact, the shape of a gravitational wave encodes information about its physical origin, be it the coalescence of two very dense objects (neutron stars and/or black holes), a supernovaexplosion, or other phenomena.Gravitational waves are very weak: the movement that the largest laser interferometers (LIGO and Virgo) are designed to observe has an amplitude of only about 10~(-19) m,whichis measured as the relative variation (strain) of the length of arms that measure 3 to 4kilometers. Achieving this requires a host of physical measurements that flow from sensors to computers. These measurements are analyzed, displayed and stored through a complexhardware and software system that are presented in this paper. Such a high precision measurement requires extremely sensitive experimental and dataanalysis techniques. The signal that continuously comes from a gravitational wave interferometer can be observed either as a function of time, or in the time-frequency domain, since this representation is adapted to the oscillatory nature of the gravitational waves. Differentdata analysis techniques are appropriate for each representation. For the time domain, we thus discuss matched filtering techniques, which can find a small signal of known form buriedin noise. The time-frequency domain is presented in conjunction with techniques used fordetecting bursts of gravitational waves, and unwanted glitches in the interferometer signal. Since multiple large gravitational wave interferometers are being made available, it is natural to take advantage of their conjoint measurements: a gravitational wave should be seen on all running detectors (with an amplitude that depends on their orientation), whereasglitches in the interferometer signal should generally not happen at the same time in the same way. This forms the basis of the coincidence and coherent data analysis methods presented here. Other important computing techniques such as Monte-Carlo calculationsand X~2 for detecting gravitational waves and estimating their parameters (direction of their source, etc.) are also presented.","以引力波探测为基础的引力波天文学是一门正在崛起的新兴交叉学科,它是继以电磁辐射为探测手段的传统天文学之后,人类观测宇宙的一个新窗口,对研究宇宙的起源和演化,拓展天文学的研究领域都有极其重要的意义。激光干涉引力波探测器的出现,更开辟了引力波探测的新纪元。引力波数据处理与分析已在世界各地迅速发展起来,为引力波天文学的研究提供了锐利的武器。系统地介绍了引力波数据分析中常用的工具软件,详细讨论了时间一频率分析、复合分析法、脉冲星计时分析法、匹配过滤器、模板、X~2检验、蒙特卡罗模拟等引力波数据分析中使用的基本方法。"

So far, their existence has been proven indirectly by Taylor and Hulse's observation on the decay of the orbital period in the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16.

These signals have long timescales,ranging from several days to several years,and require theoretical waveforms with high accuracy. Moreover,some low-frequency GW sources have complicated configurations,such as large eccentricities and precession,which leads to a large parameter space of waveforms,and numerous templates are required. Therefore,comparing with ground-based GW detection,space-borne GW detection requires more efficiency and quality for most waveform templates.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The direct detection of gravitational waves opens a new window to probe the nature of gravity, and it brings us into the era of multi-messenger astronomy. Gravitational wave has no effect on the geodesics of a test particle, but it affects the relative motion between two nearby test particles. To measure gravitational wave and its polarizations, we need to study the geodesic deviation equation for two nearby test particles. Since only the electric part of the Riemann tensor Ri0 j0 appears in the geodesic deviation equation and it has six independent components, there are up to six possible polarization states in general metric theories of gravity. In terms of the electric part of the Riemann tensor, the six polarizations are defined as follows. P_+ = -R_(x0x0)+ R_(y0y0) corresponds to the + mode, P_*= 2R_(x0y0) denotes the * mode, P_b = R_(x0x0)+ R_(y0y0) corresponds to the breathing mode, P_x = R_(x0z0) corresponds to the vector-x mode, P_x = R_(y0z0) represents to the vector-y mode, and Pl = Rz0z0 denotes the longitudinal mode. For weak, plane and null gravitational waves, these six polarizations can be classified based on their properties under the Lorentz transformation. In Einsteins general relativity, the gravitational waves are tensor waves and there are + and * modes of polarization. In Brans-Dicke theory, in addition to the + and * polarization states, the scalar breathing mode also appears, and all these three polarizations are transverse modes. In the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, the massive scalar field excites both the breathing and the longitudinal modes, so in addition to the + and * polarizations, there exists a single mix state consisting of both the breathing and the longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the longitudinal mode disappears and the mix state becomes the pure transverse breathing polarization as that in Brans-Dicke theory. The nonlinear f (R) theory of gravity can be written as a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, so the polarization states in f (R) gravity are the same as those in Horndeski theory except that there is no massless limit in f (R) gravity. In Einstein-Aether theory, due to the existence of the unit timelike vector field, the local Lorentz invariance is violated. The gravitational waves propagate with speeds different from the speed of light, and there are five independent polarization states, the + state P_+, the * state P_*, the vector-x state P_x, the vector-y state P_y and the mix state consisting of both the breathing and the longitudinal modes excited by the scalar field. In TeVeS theory, the local Lorentz invariance is also broken, so the gravitational waves in TeVeS theory propagate with speeds different from the speed of light.

Gravitational waves theory and their detection are becoming more and more interesting research areas for the theoretical and experiential physicists. In fact, with the development of science and technology, the humans have the ability to construct such sensitive ground-based and upcoming spaced detectors to observe gravitational waves(GWs) directly. LIGO claimed that we have detected the GWs firstly on September 14, 2015, and this signal originated from the event of the merger phase of binary black holes, since then we opened the prelude to GWs astronomy. The inspirals and mergers of compact binaries are among the most promising events for ground-based gravitational wave observatories. The detection of GWs and their electromagnetic (EM) signals from these sources would provide complementary information to each other. However, it is too hard to dig out the signal confidently and to localize the sources accurately. Therefore, we combine the detectors to construct a network, which can benefit for the detection and localization. In this thesis, we study the network of gravitational wave detectors and their localization performance. Firstly, we introduce the case of localization of GW150914 source. Then we show two general estimated methods of sources localization accuracy, namely, Monte-Carlo methods and analytical expression. In the end of this thesis, we will investigate the localization ability of the gravitational wave detectors networks which comprised of Chinese, Japanese, Australian detectors.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Gravitational wave detection plays an important role in exploring the universe and opening up a new chapter for multi-messenger astronomy. As the most common device used for space and ground-based gravitational wave detection, large-scale laser interferometer requires a low-noise laser as a beam source. The noise of the laser can be suppressed by utilizing the optoelectronic negative-feedback noise reduction technology to improve the sensitivity of large-scale laser interferometer. The optoelectronic negative-feedback control system can suppress laser noise by subtracting the photodetector signal from the voltage reference signal, and then calculating the modulated signal by a proportional integral differentiator to control the output power of the pump current driver. Since the photodetector signal is affected by the laser intensity, its output voltage varies within a certain range, which requires that the output voltage of the voltage reference source signal is variable. In addition, the performance of the voltage reference directly affects the overall performance of the feedback control loop, therefore it is the lower limit of laser noise suppression. We develop a high-precision lownoise program-controlled voltage reference by selecting low-noise reference chip and digital-to-analog conversion chip, designing external control circuit, using low-temperature drift coefficient components and using temperature control and electromagnetic shielding. The digital-to-analog conversion is controlled through the FPGA module programming to accurately realize the reference voltage change. The output voltage range of the developed voltage reference source is from negative 10 V to positive 10 V and the minimal precision of the voltage variation is 20 bit. The voltage noise spectral density of the developed voltage reference is below 9.6 * 10~(-6)/Hz and the noise performance of the reference source is less than the laser intensity noise in the space-based gravitational wave frequency band. The developed voltage reference source provides an important technical support for laser intensity noise suppression in gravitational wave detection.","引力波探测打开了探索宇宙的新窗口,开启了多信使天文学时代.大型激光干涉仪作为空间及地基引力波探测装置,需要使用低噪声激光光源,通过光电负反馈降噪技术可以抑制激光噪声,提高大型激光干涉仪的灵敏度.光电负反馈控制需要将光电探测器信号与电压基准源信号相减,之后经过比例积分微分器得到误差信号,来控制泵浦电流驱动器的输出功率,从而实现激光噪声抑制.由于光电探测器信号受激光强度影响,其输出电压在一定范围内变化,这就需要电压基准源信号的输出电压可变;另外,电压基准源的性能直接影响反馈控制环路的整体性能,是激光噪声抑制的下限.本文通过选定低噪声基准芯片及数模转换芯片,设计外控电路、采用低温漂系数元件、通过精密布板及电磁屏蔽等方案,研发高精度低噪声程控电压基准源;并通过可编程逻辑门阵列模块编程控制数模转换,实现程控电压基准源输出电压精密变化.结果表明:所研发的电压基准源输出电压范围为-10 V-+10 V,输出电压分辨率达20 bit,在空间引力波频段输出电压的相对噪声谱密度低于9.6 *10~(-6) Hz~(-1/2),基准源噪声性能均优于相应引力波探测中对激光强度噪声要求,为引力波探测中激光强度噪声抑制等方面提供关键器件支撑."
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Objective Gravitational waves are ripples of the curvature of space and time in the universe. They dominate the evolution and operation of the universe in the form of waves. Gravitational wave detection has been widely used by many scholars at home and abroad and has achieved breakthrough results. Gravitational wave detection is one of the most concerned frontiers of scientific research in the history of contemporary physics. Space laser heterodyne interferometer is a key component of gravitational wave detection system. The four-quadrant detector is an important part of the laser interference gravitational wave detector, which can be used for spot position detection, laser angle measurement, data transmission and reception, etc. The performance of the four-quadrant detector will directly affect the accuracy of the gravitational wave detector. Influenced by noise factors, the system signal-to-noise ratio(SNR)of laser interference gravitational wave detector and other parameters will be affected, thus affecting the detection accuracy and performance of the system. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a complete mathematical model for the position detection process of the four-quadrant detector and verify it through the simulation system, so as to analyze the factors affecting the position detection accuracy and improve the detection method. Methods In order to analyze the factors that affect the position detection accuracy of the four-quadrant detector, in this paper, firstly, the noise factors in the laser heterodyne interferometer and the relationship between the local oscillator power and the system SNR are analyzed. The mathematical theoretical model of the four-quadrant detector position detection is established, and the main factors affecting the position detection accuracy are theoretically derived. Then the position detection simulation system is established by using Monte Carlo random simulation method, and the Monte Carlo random points are used to characterize the receiving and solving process of the four-quadrant detector spot. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the theoretical results of the mathematical model, and the correctness and accuracy of the simulation results are verified. Results and Discussions The simulation system of four-quadrant detector position detection model based on Monte Carlo method is established. The simulation system is based on the Monte Carlo idea and consists of three parts: the Gaussian spot generation process, the spot center position calculation process, and the error evaluation process(Fig. 4). The estimated spot center position is compared with the true value to judge the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation method(Fig. 5). The simulation results show that due to the correlation of beat frequency signal noise among the four quadrants, the position detection accuracy is not affected by beat frequency signal noise(Fig. 6). Due to the independence of detector noise in the four quadrants, when the system SNR caused by detector noise rises from 30 dB to 44 dB, the position detection accuracy is improved(Fig. 7). The smaller the Gaussian spot radius is, the more concentrated the spot energy is, and the higher the position detection accuracy is(Fig. 8). The closer the spot center position is to the center of the four-quadrant detector photosensitive surface, the higher the position detection accuracy is(Fig. 9). Conclusions In this paper, the mathematical model of the position detection accuracy of the four-quadrant detector is studied theoretically and verified by the Monte Carlo simulation system. The key parameters that affect the position detection accuracy are obtained: system SNR, Gaussian spot radius and spot center position.","引力波探测激光干涉仪对四象限探测器性能提出了较高的技术要求。为了提升四象限探测器光斑位置检测精度,搭建四象限探测器相干探测仿真系统,构建位置检测数学模型,分析位置检测精度与系统信噪比、光斑半径和光斑质心位置三个关键参数以及相干混频增益的关系。基于蒙特卡罗仿真方法并采用LabView软件搭建四象限探测器光斑位置检测计算机仿真系统,深入分析系统中高斯光斑产生、光斑质心位置解算以及误差评判三部分主要过程,分析各个关键参数对位置检测精度的影响。仿真结果表明,提升系统信噪比、减小光斑半径以及选取靠近光敏面中心的光斑质心位置可以提高位置检测精度。将仿真结果与理论计算结果进行对比,验证了数学模型的有效性,提升了蒙特卡罗仿真置信度。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Gravitational waves(GWs), predicted by the general relativity of Albert Einstein, are ripples in space-time caused by massive accelerating objects. Since the first direct observation of GWs in 2015, more and more binary black hole mergers and neutron star merger were detected by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory(LIGO) and the Virgo interferometric detector. The construction of the third-generation(3G) gravitational wave detector(GWD), whose sensitivity is ten times that of the second-generation(2G) GWD(Advanced LIGO and Virgo), can not only push the gravitational wave astronomy towards the edge of the observable universe, but also test the fundamental laws of physics and study the nature of matter. By utilizing the abandoned underground mines, Shanxi university proposes to construct a 3G ground-based gravitational wave detector with an arm length of 10 km and a strain sensitivity of 10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2), improving the location accuracy of wave source by participating in the global GWD network. The construction of 3G GWD has many technical challenges, including ultrahigh large-scale vacuum system, ultrastable seismic isolation system, highprecision control system, high-quality laser and quantum source. Theoretically, the sensitivity of GWD with equal arm length is not limited by the laser source noise. However, in the actual scenario, the sensitivity is limited by the differences in arm length, arm cavity linewidth, arm reflectivity, arm mass, arm power, and the laser parameters. In this work, based on the design sensitivity(10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2)) of dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer, we propose the requirements for an ultra low-noise laser, including wavelength, amplitude noise, frequency noise, beam pointing noise and fundamental mode purity. The results show that in order to achieve the design sensitivity at the Fourier frequency of 100 Hz, the wavelength of the laser source should be 1.5 mum, the output power should be higher than 200 W, the amplitude noise should be better than 10-8 Hz~(-1/2), and the frequency noise should be better than 100 Hz/Hz1/2. To achieve the sensitivity of 10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2) at 10 Hz analysis frequency, the requirements for the amplitude and frequency noise of the laser source are much more stringent. This study lays a solid foundation for the analysis of laser source noise and the decomposition of interferometer indexes.","引力波探测是一项重大国际前沿科技研究,对探索许多基础科学问题具有重大意义,然而引力波探测装置的建设面临着极大的技术挑战.山西大学提出利用废弃地下矿井,建设臂长为10 km、灵敏度达10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2)的地基引力波探测装置的建设计划.理论上,等臂迈克尔逊干涉仪的灵敏度不受光源噪声的限制.但是实际的激光干涉仪受臂腔线宽差异、腔镜反射率差异、腔镜质量差异、腔内功率差异等因素限制,灵敏度依赖于激光源的指标.本文定量分析了激光源指标参数对干涉仪灵敏度的影响,并从地基引力波探测装置的设计灵敏度出发,对激光源的波长、振幅噪声、频率噪声、光束指向噪声和基模纯度提出具体要求.该分析为建设我国的地基引力波探测装置(预期灵敏度达国际上第三代探测器水平)奠定了激光源噪声分析和干涉仪指标分解等方面的坚实基础."

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The gravitational wave detection GW150914 has been realized by LIGO. The theoretical model played an important role in the data analysis. The model not only extracts the signal enveloped in the detector noise, but also recognizes that the source is a binary-black-hole merger. Besides the ground-based detectors like LIGO, pulsar timing arrays and space-based detectors detect gravitational wave in different frequency band. Soon the FAST telescope will partly serve for pulsar timing arrays in the coming year. In the near future, SKA project will strongly enhance the gravitational wave detection with pulsar timing array. Regarding to the space-based detectors, eLISA project is going on in Europe. And the LISA pathfinder works quite well which implies that most instrument techniques for eLISA are ready. Besides eLISA, there are two more plans for space-based detectors in China including Taiji and Tianqin. Among all of these gravitational wave detection projects, theoretical models are very important for signal extraction and parameters inversion. Along the development of the gravitational wave astronomy, the theoretical model research becomes more and more important and urgent. Binary compact objects are among the most important and the most realistic gravitational wave sources for all the above mentioned gravitational wave detection projects. We briefly describe the research status of theoretical models for binary compact objects in this paper. Post Newtonian method, perturbation theory of black hole and numerical relativity are all introduced. Typically these three methods are applied to the inspiral, ringdown and merger stage respectively. And more we also introduced effective one body method which combines the results of all these three methods and constructs a full model for the whole inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) process. This model is called effective one body numerical relativity (EOBNR) model which is essential in the data analysis of GW150914. Currently, post Newtonian method has achieved 4 PN order for the conservative dynamics and 3.5 PN order for gravitational radiation part. Unfortunately the PN order is less for spinning black holes. With higher PN order, ones expect the description is more accurate, and it is valid for nearer separated binary compact objects. Perturbation theory for black holes includes two formalisms. One is metric perturbation which corresponds to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. One is curvature perturbation which corresponds to the Teukolsky equation. For Schwarzschild black hole these two formalisms are equivalent. The analytical solution to the Teukolsky equation is not clear yet. In most applications, ones use numerical methods to treat the Teukolsky equation. After the merger of two black holes, the space-time can always be looked as a perturbation of a Kerr black hole. This stage corresponds to the ringdown. So the ringdown stage can always be treated by perturbation theory. In addition, if the masses of the two black hole are extremely different, the effect of the small black hole can be treated as a perturbation to the big black hole.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The first direct detection of gravitational wave has been realized by LIGO 100 years after Einsteins theoretical prediction. It opens a new window for human to observe our Universe and initiates the age of Gravitational Wave Astronomy. The data analysis of gravitational wave detection is a typically signal extraction problem and the matched filtering technique has shown to be an optimal method in extracting weak signal buried in strong Gaussian noises. Matched filtering requires the accurate gravitational waveforms. It is also essential for the parameter estimation of the gravitational wave source, with which the GW150914 was recognized as a binary of 29 and 36 solar masses black holes merging about 1.3 billion light years away. Nowadays, other laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as Virgo, KAGRA and the third LIGO in the India, IndIGO, are under construction. The space-borne detection projects including eLISA, Taiji and TianQin are also in progress. The pulsar timing approach with FAST, SKA and other radio telescope arrays to detect gravitational wave are also in the rapid development. It is foreseeable the gravitational wave astronomy in the wide frequency band from 10~(-10) to 1000 Hz will be realized in the near future. As such, the matched filtering plays an important role, and correspondingly the theoretical research of gravitational wave source models becomes urgent and important. For astrophysical realistic objects without symmetries in general, the analytical treatment of Einstein equation becomes nearly intractable. The numerical relativity then becomes an essential method and tool for solving the Einstein equation. We briefly introduce the state of art research of numerical relativity in the viewpoint of gravitational wave astronomy.","引力波直接探测已经被LIGO成功实现.在这个重大实验发现中,理论模型的重要作用得到充分体现.有效单体数值相对论模型不仅提升了既定硬件的灵敏度,把实验结果的置信度从4.6sigma加强到5.1sigma,而且还辨认出该引力波源是并合双黑洞.以这次实验结果所给出的双星并合事件率推断,地面引力波探测器接下来还会给出更多的引力波事件.这些引力波实验数据可以被用来进行天文学和基本物理学的研究.随着数据的积累和新脉冲星的加入,脉冲星计时计划的引力波探测精度也越来越高.空间引力波探测计划包括eLISA、太极和天琴等也在积极准备中.可以预期,引力波天文学将逐渐形成.在引力波天文学中,从信号读取到参数反演都离不开理论模型.不做任何解析近似的数值相对论是现实引力波源建模的通用工具.爱因斯坦方程的复杂数学结构和所需的庞大程序构架是数值相对论的两大困难.结合引力波天文学,本文对数值相对论的关键困难、发展历程、研究现状和在引力天文学中的应用等给出比较系统的描述."
"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：the Due to the limitation of the optical-mechanical platform of the laser heterodyne interferometry system, the Doppler frequency shift cannot be simulated. Moreover, commercial signal generators cannot realize various types of high-complexity intersatellite heterodyne interference signal simulations. It is difficult to conduct ground tests of the phasemeter for space gravitational wave detection detailed. Therefore, the characteristics of heterodyne interference signals were analysed, the realization principle and method of the signal simulation system were studied, and then the simulation system of the laser heterodyne interference signal for space gravitational wave detection was designed. First, the simulation of the heterodyne interference signal was applied to the DDS. Then, the influence of the Doppler effect was simulated by offsetting the overall frequency. Next, based on the mixed congruential algorithm, shot noise was generated and modulated into the heterodyne interference signal. Finally, with the usage of FPGA, the system hardware platform was built. The time domain and frequency domain characteristics of the generated signals were analysed by an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyser. The experimental result shows that the spurious suppression of the system is-53 dBc and the harmonic suppression is-47 dBc at 2-20 MHz. The signal generated by the system is in good agreement with the expectations which satisfies the ground test requirements of the phasemeter for space gravitational wave detection.","由于激光外差干涉测量系统光机平台无法模拟多普勒频移,并且商用信号发生器无法实现多种类、高复杂度的星间外差干涉信号模拟,不能对空间引力波探测的相位计进行全面测试。通过分析外差干涉信号的特性,研究信号模拟系统的实现原理及方法,设计了空间引力波探测激光外差干涉信号模拟系统。首先,应用直接数字合成器(DDS)模拟外差干涉信号。其次,通过频率偏移方式模拟多普勒效应,应用混合同余算法生成散粒噪声并调制到外差干涉信号中。最后,基于FPGA搭建系统硬件平台,通过示波器及频谱分析仪分析生成信号的时频特性。实验结果表明,信号模拟系统在2~ 20 MHz的频率范围内杂波抑制度为-53 dBc,谐波(二次)抑制达到-47 dBc,生成信号的时频特性符合理论预期,满足空间引力波探测相位计的地面测试需求。"

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe is a long-standing cosmological puzzle remaining to be solved. This slight excess of the baryonic matter is a key input to the big bang nucleosynthesis and therefore is responsible for the generation of the light elements in the early universe and finally the formation of stars and galaxies at a later time. This excess has been measured in several different ways. In particular, the value of this number has been precisely measured from studies of the temperature an-isotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation by the Planck collaboration. Despite the concordance of the experimental measurements of this excess from different independent studies, none of the theoretical explanation of this problem is satisfactory and well accepted. The theoretical explanations of the baryon asymmetry are reviewed in this article. While there are many baryogenesis mechanisms, we focus on the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis, which is a highly testable scenario and is within the reach of current high energy colliders. The physical picture of the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis is then discussed. This is an interdisciplinary research area closely related to cosmology and the fundamental theory governing the particle physics. Therefore solutions to this cosmological problem may shed light on the searches for new physics governing particle interactions at the high energy frontier as well as the low energy intensity frontier. In particular, the necessity of going beyond the standard model of particle physics is discussed, due to the incapability of the standard model to generate the observed baryon asymmetry, with the solution of resorting to new physics capable of incorporating a new source of CP-violation and a Higgs potential that can accommodate a strongly first order electroweak phase transition. These requirements call for new particle interactions beyond the standard model and therefore can provide additional insight on new physics searches at high energy colliders and low energy precision measurements such as the searches for electric dipole moments of electrons, neutrons, protons and atoms. Also briefly discussed is the physical opportunities associated with the stochastic gravitational waves generated from a first order electroweak phase transition, which is another emerging window for probing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore can provide another independent test of the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis. The possibility of primordial black hole formation from the first order phase transition, which can serve as a non-particle candidate for the dark matter, and its possible detection with gravitational waves is also briefly introduced.","宇宙中的物质主要以重子类物质而非反物质存在.这一物质反物质的不对称性或者重子类物质的起源问题是长久未解决的宇宙学难题.本文着重介绍了目前很流行的电弱重子数产生机制,即在电弱相变过程中重子数产生的机制及其在超出粒子物理标准模型的新物理模型中的实现以及实验检验.首先详细介绍了该机制的物理图像.其次,因为重子数的产生需要在新物理模型中引入额外的CP(电荷共轭-宇称)破坏以克服标准模型中CP破坏强度不足的弱点,所以也对此进行了简要介绍并讨论了这类新的CP破坏源和粒子电偶极矩的精密测量以及新物理探索的关联.还讨论了另一个对于新物理模型的要求即强一阶电弱相变的实现.最后介绍了一阶电弱相变过程中随机背景引力波的产生、其在基于太空的引力波干涉仪探测器中的实验探测以及此类引力波与新物理模型探索之间的关联.其他如一阶相变过程中原初黑洞的产生及其探测也在本文中作了简要介绍."

However, the implementation of high power lasers can also result in parametric instability.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：During the decoupling process in the early Universe, photons were interact-ing with electrons by Thompson scattering. The anisotropies in the spatial distribution of photon gas will give rise to a net polarization of photon gas after this scattering. This is the origin of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Backgroud (CMB) radiation that has just been observed recently. There has been a simple approximate analytic solution of polariza-tion consisting of the primordial perturbation at the peak of the decoupling, multiplying the decoupling duration. In this paper, starting from the Boltzmann equation for the photons, we calculate analytically the CMB polarizations caused by the scalar and tensor types of the primordial perturbations for a general expression for the optical depth function, and the results are valid for a generic recombination process. For the scalar type of perturbations Fst the resulting approximate analytical polarization is betas～--CFs(taud)△taud, where taud , and △taud are the decoupling time and the decoupling duration, respectively, and C approx= (0.08~ 0.12) depending on recombination models. For the tensorial type of perturbations, the calcula-tion is a bit more complicated, and we do it in the long wave-length limit.

"请用中文重写以下论文摘要：Since the first detection of GW150914, a larger amount of stellar binary black hole(sBBH) mergers have been detected by LIGO/Virgo collaboration with high confidence. By analyzing the gravitational wave(GW) signals, one can obtain crucial physical properties of these sBBH mergers, including their chirp mass, spin, and luminosity distance, etc. The origin of sBBHs may encode in the distribution of these physical properties. Here, the curent status of the study on sBBHs spins is reviewed. First, various formation mechanisms of sBBHs are briefly introduced, and these mechanisms include: 1) sBBHs are formed via the evolution of massive binary stars(EMBS channel); 2) sBBHs are formed via the dynamical interactions with surrounding(compact) stars in dense stellar clusters(dynamical channel); etc. The origin of spins for sBBHs originated from the black hole formation processes is also introduced. One may expect that the spin distributions resulting from different sBBH formation channels are different. For example, the two components of each sBBH resulting from the EMBS channel have spins more or less aligned with each other, while they may be randomly distributed if the sBBH is resulting from the dynamical channel. Therefore, the spin distribution obtained from GW observations may be used to distinguish the EMBS channel from the dynamical channel and further reveal the origin of sBBHs. The general methods for constraining the origin of sBBHs via their spin distribution are then introduced. The results obtained by recent works using the GW observations of sBBHs(GWTC) are summarized. Finally, a summary and a short prospect are given for the future demography study of the sBBH spins measured by next generation ground-based GW detectors.","自2015年以来,人们已经探测到93例恒星级双黑洞并合引力波事件,测量了双黑洞质量、自旋和距离等参数,并获得了其统计分布。不同双黑洞起源机制产生的双黑洞性质分布,特别是自旋分布,会显著不同,其可用来限制双黑洞起源。简单回顾了双星演化和动力学相互作用等双黑洞形成机制及自旋来源;综述了利用自旋限制双黑洞起源的一般方法和常见模型,以及利用LIGO/Virgo引力波数据取得的相关进展,并对未来发展前景进行了展望。"

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：100年前,爱因斯坦从广义相对论出发,在理论上预言了引力波的存在.自20世纪60年代开始,科学家开始试图在实验上检测来自不同天体物理过程和宇宙学演化过程的引力波信号.经过了50多年的努力,位于美国的LIGO引力波探测器在2015年9月14日终于首次直接探测到了双黑洞合并的引力波信号,为人类的天文学研究打开了一扇全新的引力波窗口.可以预见到在不久的将来引力波研究会从各个不同的引力波频段上探索宇宙的未知信息.本文从引力波的物理内容、空间和地面的探测手段及噪声限制、引力波在天体物理学等方面的可预见的科学产出、国内和国际上在这个研究领域的最新发展动态等方面,对引力波天文学做了简单的综述和讨论.另外,本文还就LIGO的首例引力波直接探测事件GW150914及其背后的双黑洞合并的物理过程做了一定的介绍.","On September 14, 2015, the first detection of gravitational waves at the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, in the United States, marked the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy, that opens a new window looking into the violent sides of our Universe. It is very promising that at other wavelengths detections of gravitational waves with various space-based and ground-based observatories will show up in the near future of this century. These observatories include space-based laser interferometer antennas, pulsar timing arrays, cosmic microwave background satellites, etc. The field of gravitational waves will reveal a lot of new information on the unknown aspects of our Universe, including, (i) the cosmic inflation in the early Universe, (ii) the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, and supermassive black hole binaries that are related to the history of galaxy mergers, (iii) the stellar evolution of binary systems, especially the stellar mass black hole binaries, (iv) the inspiral and subsequent merger of binary neutron stars, and the equation of state of superdense nuclear matters, (v) various fundamental aspects of gravitational theories, and so on. To guarantee the success of gravitational-wave observations, many aspects of gravitational-wave detectors have to be addressed, especially the principles of design, the understanding of various noises and possible ways to eliminate and/or suppress these noises. In the paper, we briefly review the physics of the general relativity and gravitational waves. Different classes of gravitational-wave detectors operating or to be operated at complementary wavelength bands from nano-Hz to kilo-Hz are presented, while their various noises and practical methods to overcome them are also discussed. The two Chinese projects, Taiji and TianQin, which are both proposed as space-based laser interferometer antennas, are reviewed. Their brief histories, project rationales, scientific aims, pros and cons in the upcoming gravitational-wave era, are discussed. We also review the expected fruitful science to our understandings of astrophysics and cosmology with the gravitational-wave astronomy, with more gravitational-wave detections. Gravitational waves bring in information that is complementary to what can be obtained with electromagnetic observations. For example, gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars are supposed to reveal the mechanism of the progenitor of short gamma-ray burst. The possible joint observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts will lead to a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. Finally, the first direct detection event, GW150914, and the merger of binary black holes behind the scene, are discussed in context. The events implications for astrophysics, black hole physics, alternative gravity theories are briefly presented."

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：本文研究了引力波望远镜的装调误差对望远镜的TTL(tilt-to-length,角度抖动与光程读出之间的)耦合噪声的影响。保持其他参量不变,仅对引力波望远镜中的某项装调公差进行赋值,仿真分析引力波望远镜中的某项装调公差对出瞳位置变化的影响,进而计算出激光干涉信号经过全玻璃激光干涉仪最终在四象限光电探测器上进行干涉时,由于引力波望远镜的装调公差的存在导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化情况。通过对比发现,引力波望远镜的主镜与次镜的距离公差,对引力波望远镜的TTL耦合噪声的影响大于其他光学元件之间的距离公差对TTL耦合噪声的影响。主镜和次镜之间的距离公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化与次镜和三镜之间的距离公差、三镜和四镜之间的距离公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化符号相反;光阑和主镜之间的距离装调公差对TTL耦合噪声的变化影响很小,可以忽略不计。各个光学元件的距离装调公差导致的TTL耦合噪声的变化量与抖动角度之间呈抛物线规律分布。在装调空间引力波望远镜时,应着重控制主镜与次镜之间的距离误差。并且可以使用次镜和三镜之间的距离装调误差、三镜和四镜之间的距离装调误差导致的TTL耦合噪声来抵消由装调主镜和次镜之间的距离误差导致的TTL耦合噪声。","Objective The influence of the installation and adjustment error of gravitational wave telescopes on the TTL coupling noise of the telescopes is studied. Since the TTL coupling noise is the second largest noise source, during the actual engineering of gravitational wave telescopes, the installation and adjustment will affect the TTL coupling noise, with little correlation between the telescope′s installation and adjustment and TTL coupling noise. Therefore, the research on the relationship between the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance and TTL coupling noise is significant for the engineering of gravitational wave telescopes, and how the gravitational wave telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance will affect the TTL coupling noise determines whether the final gravitational wave telescope meets the requirements for use. The research results can guide the installation and installation and adjustment of gravitational wave telescopes. Methods We can judge the installation and adjustment processes of gravitational wave telescopes by simulating and designing a gravitational wave telescope that meets the requirements of the wave-front difference index, calculating the TTL coupling noise of the designed telescope, and analyzing the influence of the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance on the TTL coupling noise. The variable of installation and adjustment tolerance is sensitive to TTL coupling noise. By controlling the variable method with other parameters unchanged, only a certain installation and adjustment tolerance is assigned in the gravitational wave telescope, and the influence of the installation and adjustment tolerance in the telescope on the change of the exit pupil position is simulated and analyzed. Then when the laser interference signal passes through the laser interferometer and finally interferes with the four-quadrant detector, the variation of TTL coupling noise due to the installation and adjustment tolerance of the telescope is calculated. The relationship between the TTL coupling noise of the intersatellite laser interferometry system and the sensitivity of the telescope′s installation and adjustment tolerance is established. In addition, the requirements of the TTL coupling noise are employed as the criterion to establish the model relationship between the installation and adjustment tolerance and the change of TTL coupling noise. Results and Discussions Comparison shows that the distance tolerance between the primary mirror and the secondary mirror of the gravitational wave telescope exerts more influence on the TTL coupling noise of the gravitational wave telescope than the distance tolerance between other optical elements exerts on the TTL coupling noise. The change in TTL coupling noise due to the distance tolerance between the primary and secondary mirrors is opposite in sign to that due to the distance tolerance between the secondary and third mirrors and between the third and fourth mirrors. The installation and adjustment tolerance of the distance between the diaphragm and the primary mirror has little effect on the variation of the TTL coupling noise and can be ignored. The variation of the TTL coupling noise caused by the distance installation and adjustment tolerance of each optical element and the jitter angle are distributed in a parabolic law. By analyzing the installation and adjustment tolerance of the gravitational wave telescope, the relationship between the installation and adjustment tolerance of the gravitational wave telescope and the change of TTL coupling noise is established. Via the above analysis and discussion, the sensitivity of the TTL coupling noise of the gravitational wave telescope is known. The primary and secondary distance sensitivity of the mirror is the highest, which is 15.489 times the sensitivity of the secondary and third mirrors, and 9.311 times the sensitivity of the third and fourth mirrors."

The excitation magnetic poles of motor areal so the electromagnets of suspension system, thus there is a serious nonlinear coupling relationship between the traction and levitation force of vehicle. The adjustment of the suspension system during operation will affect the traction system, which leads to traction force fluctuations. In this paper, a mathematical model of linear synchronous motor considering the influence of the suspension system is established. Aiming at the problem of traction fluctuations, a control strategy based on flux observation is proposed, which uses the extended electromotive force (EEMF) method to observe the flux. By applying the flux parameter to the speed loop and current loop, the q-axis current can be adjusted online to suppress the low-frequency traction fluctuation caused by the suspension system. However, the performance of this strategy is limited when the flux observation error exists at low speed region. Accordingly, a composite control strategy combining active disturbance rejection and flux observation algorithm is proposed, which compensates the flux observation error and other disturbances through the extend state observer (ESO).

In this work, we report a low-noise single-frequency laser designed for space-based gravitational wave detector. The laser is based on a master oscillator power amplifier(MOPA), which is designed to possess a low-power, narrow-linewidth seed laser acting as master oscillator(MO)and an all polarization-maintaining fiber amplifier acting as power amp lifier(PA). The amplifier that uses a robust mechanical design consists of an Yb-doped double-clad fiber forward pumped by wavelength-locked 976 nm pump laser diode(LD)to achieve 2.13 W of output power and 70 dB of signal-noise ratio(SNR). To suppress the relative intensity noise(RIN)in a millhertz regime(1 mHz-1 Hz), we characterize the power stabilization of a pump diode laser based on a proportional-integral-derivative(PID)feedback control loop where an in-loop photodetector is used. The power fluctuation can be converted into the fluctuation of the current signal by the photodiode, the current signal is converted into the voltage signal and amplified by a transimpedance circuit. Then, the voltage signal is compared with the voltage reference signal, and the error signal is achieved to adjust real-timely the drive current of the pump laser diode. This is a good way to significantly suppress the RIN of a laser at low frequencies, but the measured RIN below 4 mHz is still higher than -60 dBc/Hz. In order to further suppress the RIN to lower than 4 mHz, an active precise temper ature control technology is used to suppress the thermal noise from pump LD and fiber coupler. To assess the RIN milliertz regime, we design an RIN measurement system consisting of a high-precision signal acquisition card(24 bit)and a computer program based on LabVIEW. The measurement range of the system is 2 muHz - 102.4 kHz and the frequency resolution up to 2 muHz, much better than the counterparts of commercial instruments. By stabilizing the fiber amplifier pump LD current and the temperature of pump LD and the temperature of fiber coupler, the out-of-loop RINs are measured to be -63.4 dBc/Hz@1 mHz and -105.8 dBc/Hz@1 Hz, and in a milliertz regime of 1 mHz-1 Hz, the RIN is below -60 dBc/Hz. The results show that the feedback control of the fiber amplifier pump LD current and the temperature control of the key devices can effectively suppress the RIN in the millihertz frequency band, which lays a foundation for further improving the intensity noise performance in the low frequency band."

GWs detection is one of the most important frontiers of physics today. Ground-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, have successfully confirmed the existence of GWs. GWs have become a new window for a human to observe the universe. Due to the influence of ground vibration noise,terrestrial gravity gradient noise and other factors,groundbased detectors are not sensitive to GWs below 1 Hz. Space-based detectors are free from such noises and can be made very large,thereby expanding the frequency range downwards to 10-4 Hz,where exciting GW sources are waiting to be explored. Space-based GW detectors are expected to bring even more information about the universe through low-frequency GWs. A highly stable and long-lifetime laser system is a key component of the space-based GW detector,and the output power,intensity noise,frequency noise and other properties of the laser directly affect the sensitivity of the space-based GW detector. Thus, space-based GW detectors put forward much higher and stricter requirements for the laser. After widely experimental and industrial surveys,the baseline architecture for the laser for space-based GW detector consists of a low-power, low-noise master oscillator followed by a power amplifier with 2~10 W continuous-wave output. So,lasers consisting of a Master Oscillator and a Power Amplifier (MOPA) have been identified as the most-promising architecture for the space-based GW detector. In this review, we focused on the research progress of low-noise MOPA lasers in LISA,TianQin and Taiji missions. As in other applications of precision interferometry,1064 nm was chosen as the laser wavelength,due to the availability of high-quality bulk optics and the traditional low-noise Nd:YAG laser source represented by the Non-Planar Ring Oscillator(NPRO).The performance of different MOPA lasers for LISA injected by NPRO(m-NPRO),fiber laser and External Cavity Diode Laser(ECDL)were compared,and the m- NPRO has been identified as the most-promising MO architecture for the LISA laser,and the baseline architecture consists of a low-power,low-noise m-NPRO followed by a diode-pumped Yb-fiber amplifier with ~2 W output. As for the Relative Intensity Noise (RIN), the m-NPRO meets the LISA requirement. As to the Chinese space-based GW detection projects,the research progress and spatial test results of lasers were elaborated. A DBR laser was designed for the TianQin-1 mission as the space laser in the laser interferometer,and was successfully verified in the TianQin-1 mission. The laser passed the environment performance verification under the aerospace standard. Meanwhile,a high stability laser source at 1064 nm for Taiji-1 satellite was reported. The key component of the laser source was a NonPlanar Ring Oscillator(NPRO)solid laser with linewidth of 260 Hz. The frequency noise and power noise of Laser source were greatly improved by applying precision driving current control and temperature control. Furthermore,around the requirements of the noise performance of lasers by space-based GW detectors,the principle and progress of intensity noise suppression and frequency noise suppression were described,and the main achievements of photoelectric feedback suppression technology for intensity noise suppression and PDH technology for frequency noise suppression were discussed respectively."

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：短时标伽马射线暴(简称短暴) GRB 170817A是人类发现的第一个与引力波事件成协的伽马暴,为深入研究短暴的发生机制提供了宝贵的机会,其中它的多波段余辉辐射很可能展示了喷流的角向结构.而有关短暴的大样本统计研究表明,如果用高斯函数来唯象描述喷流结构,很可能需要引入两个高斯函数才能够把GRB 170817A的辐射和其他普通的短暴统一起来.换言之, GRB 170817A的瞬时辐射很可能来自具有更大张角的额外喷流成分.因此,为了检验这种双高斯喷流结构和GRB 170817A余辉数据的相容性,本文计算了该喷流结构在偏轴观测下的多波段余辉,发现外高斯成分的引入能够很好地解释GRB 170817A余辉数据的早期上扬趋势.在此基础上,我们还计算了喷流在并合抛射物中的传播和突破过程,表明这些过程可以自然导致观测限制所得的双高斯喷流结构,从而展现出了模型的整体自洽性.此外,对喷流传播过程的观测限制也为我们了解并合抛射物的性质提供了新的线索.","The short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) GRB 170817A was the first observed GRB associated with a gravitational-wave event, providing a valuable opportunity to further study the producing mechanism of SGRBs. Its multi-wavelength afterglow emissions probably reveal the angular structure of the jet to us. And, if the jet structure is described phenomenologically by a Gaussian function, large sample statistical studies on SGRBs show that we probably need to introduce two-Gaussian functions to unify the emissions from GRB 170817A with other normal SGRBs. In other words, GRB 170817As prompt emission is likely from an additional component of a jet with a larger angle. Therefore, in order to test the compatibility between this two-Gaussian jet structure and the afterglow data of GRB 170817A, we calculate the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves from such an off-axis jet structure, and find that the introduction of the outer Gaussian component can well explain the early uptrend of the GRB 170817A afterglow data. On this basis, we also calculate the propagation and breakout processes of the jet in the merger ejecta, which shows that these processes can naturally lead to the two-Gaussian jet structure obtained by the observational constraint, thus showing the overall self-consistency of the model. Furthermore, the observational constraint on the jet propagation process also provides a new clue for understanding the properties of merger ejecta."

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：广义相对论是继牛顿万有引力理论后,在强引力场、强动态时空区域更精准的引力理论,大量的天文观测验证了广义相对论的正确性。但广义相对论与量子理论在逻辑体系上不相容,广义相对论还存在时空奇点的理论问题,宇宙学中还存在暗物质和暗能量的引力本质问题等。在使用Yunes等人提出的Einstein-aether理论修改引力波模板的基础上,用Fisher Matrix的参数估计法,探讨了几个典型双星系统对修改引力模板的参数估计所能达到的参数估计精度,以及LIGO和VIRGO已经发现的11个双星并合事件应对修改引力的限制能力;最后,使用匹配因子的方法,探讨修改引力的参数对引力波模板的影响。如果Einstein-aether理论只是微小修正广义相对论引力波波形,11个双星引力波事件可以对Einstein-aether理论的3个参数给出限制;如果Einstein-aether理论波形与广义相对论引力波波形存在明显偏离,对Einstein-aether理论的检验需要更仔细的引力波波形研究和数据分析。","General relativity is a more accurate gravitational theory for strong gravitational field and dynamic space-time region after Newtons theory of gravity.A large number of astronomical observations have verified the theory of general relativity.However,general relativity and quantum theory are not compatible logically.There are also some theoretical problems in general relativity,such as the singularity of space-time,the problem of dark matter and dark energy in cosmology.Based on modified waveform of the Einstein-ather theory proposed by Yunes and his coworkers,Fisher matrix method is used to discuss the parameter estimation accuracy of several typical binary systems,and the ability of 11 binary merging events discovered by LIGO and Virgo are used to constrain the modified gravity.Finally,using the matching factor to discuss the influence of the modified gravitational parameters on the gravitational wave template.If Einstein-ather theory just slightly modifies the gravitational wave waveform of general relativity,11 binary gravitational wave events can limit the three parameters of Einstein-ather theory.If the waveforms of Einstein-ather theory deviate significantly from the waveforms of general relativity,the test of Einsteinather theory needs more careful study of gravitational wave waveforms and data analysis."

We start with the Newtonian gravity and Einstein gravity to introduce the two major leaps of the historical pursuits on the origin of gravity. Then we introduce the recent developments on the origin of gravity from the point of view of modified gravity, quantum gravity and holographic gravity. For Newtonian gravity, we start with Kepler's law on planetary motion to introduce the Newton's universal law of gravitation, and recent developments on the modified Newtonian dynamics and dark matter; for Einstein gravity, we explain the geometrization of gravity, and introduce the application of Einstein gravity on cosmology and gravitational waves; for modified gravity, we introduce it from the point of view of extra gravitational degrees of freedom, higher derivative gravity and higher dimensional gravity; for quantum gravity, we introduce it from the point of view of covariant quantum gravity, canonical quantum gravity and other scenarios of quantum gravity; for holographic gravity, we introduce its holographic picture, emergent properties and its connection with quantum information. However, the answer to the question of gravity origin still remains unknown. We point out here that three possible roads to approach the nature of gravity can be taken in future. The first one is the coming observations of gravitational waves from both ground-borne and space-borne gravitational-wave detectors. A system involving either black hole or neutron star has certainly run into the regime of strong gravity, which is quite different from previous tests for general relativity that is in the regime of weak gravity. The gravitational-wave observation will most likely provide us with clues on classical gravity with any possible deviations if Einstein gravity does modify itself at classical level. The second one is the understanding of the cosmic acceleration at both early-time and late-time. The cosmic acceleration at early-time is supposed to be driven by cosmic inflation, and the cosmic acceleration at late-time is supposed to be driven by the cosmological constant or alternatively dark energy. Future precise observations of radiation fluctuations and matter fluctuations will show us the way approach the nature of quantum gravity. The third one is the cognition of the relation of quantum gravity and quantum information. The past fifty years or so of pursuit on quantum gravity has leaded us to the path on the conjecture that quantum gravity might be emerged from quantum information. Although the perspective of this idea is not clear, it might be our best shot for now."

The missions such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) initiated by NASA and ESA, New Gravitational Wave Observatory (NGO) initiated by ESA, and Tianqin program and Taiji program proposed by China, have high demands on the laser frequency noise at low Fourier frequencies between 0.1 mHz and 1 Hz. In order to fully meet the demands of those missions, the development of ultrastable lasers with higher frequency stability and coherence has never been suspended. Currently, the most popular way to achieve ultra-stable lasers is to stabilize the laser frequency onto a high-finesse Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity by using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) method. However, it requires fine alignment of free-space optical components and precise spatial mode matching, which dramatically increases the complexity and bulk of the system and is easily disturbed by the external environment. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements in the transportable applications of ultra-stable laser systems. In this article, an alternative approach is proposed, which uses an optical fiber-delay-line (FDL) as a frequency discriminator to stabilize the laser frequency. This approach has the advantages of high compactness, high reliability, small volume, and light weight, which make it a viable candidate for future laser-based gravitational wave detection missions. Methods The frequency stabilization of lasers is realized by using an unequal arm heterodyne Michelson fiber interferometer composed of an optical fiber delay line of 500 m. In order to reduce the influence of vibration noises on frequency-stabilized lasers, the optical fiber delay line of 500 m is precisely coiled on a low vibration sensitivity fiber spool. Then, the entire interferometer is placed in a small vacuum chamber, where all components such as an optical delay line of 500 m, single mode broadband coupler module (SMCM), and acoustic-optic modulator (AOM) are installed in a structurally stable thermal shielding system (Fig. 3). In addition, a two-stage active thermal controller is used to reduce the temperate fluctuation on the optical fiber interferometer. The first stage temperature stabilization is applied on the vacuum chamber with a temperature fluctuation of less than 5 mK over a 24 h period. The second stage temperature stabilization is applied on the fifth-layer thermal shield using thermoelectric coolers (TECs) mounted between the shield and the vacuum chamber, and the temperature fluctuation can be further minimized within 0.2 mK. Finally, by comparing with an independent ultra-stable laser of 1550 nm with better frequency stability via an optical frequency comb, the performance of the laser is measured. Results and Discussions The thermal time constant of the thermal shielding system is 6 h, and the temperature fluctuation of the inner fiber caused by the outermost thermal shielding can be suppressed to the original 4*10~(-7). For a temperature perturbation of 0.2 mK, the induced frequency instability of stabilized laser is 9*10~(-16). By comparing with another ultra-stable laser, the measured frequency noise power spectral density is lower than 30 Hz/Hz~(1/2) at Fourier frequencies from 30 mHz to 1 Hz (Fig. 6), in comparison with the pre-stabilization requirement for the LISA mission. The Allan variance of the beat note is also analyzed. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, the fractional frequency instability of 1.2*10~(-14) at averaging time of 1 s and that of 3*10~(-13) at averaging time of 1000 s are achieved. However, the result is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the calculated thermal effect."

When the laser light intensity of 1W was incident, the stray light intensity needs to be suppressed to less than 10 -10 W, otherwise the measurement accuracy of the main parameter optical path difference will be seriously affected. Aiming at the background of this application, the feasibility of Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters for mirror surface reflection characteristics reconstructed by stray light test data was considered when the thin beam incident on the mirror surface. In the traditional measurement of BRDF, four corners were required. The system was complex and inconvenient for real-time application. Based on the isotropic optical elements and the symmetry of mirror stray light model, considering the plane mirror, curved mirror and beam diffraction effect, measurement error and other factors, a method reconstructing the BRDF parameters by one-dimensional measurement the scattering of several points with the plane mirror rotation in the meridian plane was proposed, and the feasibility and measurement accuracy were verified by numerical methods."

"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：经过近几十年的发展,宇宙学的研究已经进入精确宇宙学时代。根据Planck测量结果和LambdaCDM模型,只需要6个参数就可以在统计意义上重现出与观测数据基本符合的宇宙演化历史。但是实际上,当前宇宙学领域中还存在许多未解决的重要科学问题,而且不同的观测数据在基于基本LambdaCDM模型进行宇宙学参数推断时会出现一些不一致性。这些问题的回答都需要对基本LambdaCDM模型进行扩展,并对额外引入的参数进行精确的测量。目前主流的宇宙学探针主要是针对宇宙的膨胀历史和宇宙的结构增长进行观测的光学(以及近红外)项目,因此它们可能存在着相似的系统误差。发展全新的非光学观测手段的宇宙学探针对于宇宙学未来的研究至关重要。因为引力波振幅携带了绝对光度距离的信息,所以能够帮助建立真正的距离红移关系,用以研究宇宙的膨胀历史。这种引力波观测被称为标准汽笛。宇宙学研究是天琴、LISA等空间引力波探测器的重要研究目标之一。这些探测器预计都可以在未来观测到大量的引力波事件,为宇宙学研究(特别是高红移宇宙)提供珍贵的观测数据。本文参考相关的文献,介绍了天琴标准汽笛数据限制宇宙学参数能力的情况。考虑了pop Ⅲ、Q3nod和Q3d三种大质量黑洞双星模型,结果表明,对于不同的大质量黑洞双星模型,天琴项目对宇宙学参数的限制能力各有不同,其中Q3nod模型下的限制能力最强。天琴的标准汽笛探测有助于打破其他观测手段所导致的宇宙学参数简并,从而有效地提升宇宙学参数的测量精度。我们有理由相信,未来的引力波观测与光学和射电观测相结合将把宇宙膨胀历史的探索推进至一个全新的层面,为探测哈勃常数大小、揭示暗能量的本质属性提供帮助。","After decades of development,the research of cosmology has entered the epoch of precision cosmology. According to the Planck observational results and the LambdaCDM model,we need only 6 parameters to reproduce the evolution history of the universe which is consistent with the observed data in a statistical sense. However,in fact,there are still many unsolved important scientific problems in the field of cosmology,and there will be some inconsistencies in different observational data when inferring cosmological parameters based on the basic LambdaCDM model. The answers to these questions require extension of the basic LambdaCDM model and accurately measurements of the additional parameters. At present,the mainstream cosmological probes are mainly optical(and near-infrared)observations of the expansion history and structural growth of the universe,so they may have similar systematic errors. It is very important for the future research of cosmology to develop new non-optical observational probes. Because the amplitude of gravitational wave carries the information of absolute luminosity distance,it can help us to establish the real distance-redshift relation and study the expansion history of the universe. This observation of gravitational waves is knownstandard siren. Cosmological research is one of the important research objectives of the Tianqin space gravitational wave detector,which is expected to be able to observe a large number of gravitational wave events in the future,providing valuable observational data for the study of cosmology(especially at high redshift). In this paper,we introduce previous researches about the ability of Tianqin standard siren data to constrain the cosmological parameters. We consider pop Ⅲ,Q3nod and Q3d models. The results show that for different binary models of massive black holes,the Tianqin project yields to different constraining results on the cosmological parameters,and the Q3nod model has the strongest ability. The standard siren detection of Tianqin is helpful to break the degeneracy of cosmological parameters caused by other observation methods,so as to effectively improve the measurement accuracy of cosmological parameters. We have reason to believe that the future gravitational wave observations combined with optical and radio observations will promote the exploration of the history of cosmic expansion to a new level,and provide help to detect the size of Hubble constant and reveal the nature of dark energy."

Various gravitational wave sources in such a frequency band are believed to be of considerable interest in astronomy and cosmology. The typical gravitational wave sources of a space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna are the super (intermediate) mass black hole merger, extreme (intermediate) mass ratio in-spiral, galactic binaries of compact stars, and stochastic gravitational wave background. The gravitational wave sources within the 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band can help us understand the mystery of the universe's structural formation, evolution of massive black holes and its harbored galaxies, nature of gravity near the horizon of these massive black holes, and history of the early universe beyond the cosmic microwave background. To design a mission to achieve the abovementioned scientific impacts, considerable attention should be paid to several issues, such as orbital design and arm-length choice. The success of a space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection mission requires a pico-meter precision inter-satellite laser ranging interferometer system and a state-of-the-art drag-free control system because of the weakness of the gravitational wave signals. The inter-satellite laser ranging interferometer system comprises four subsystems: stable laser source, stable laser telescope, ultra-precise laser interferometer, and ultra-precise phasemeter. Techniques, such as arm-locking, time-delay interferometry, sideband scheme, differential wave-front sensing, and pointing control, should be employed to suppress the laser frequency noise, clock frequency noise, and laser pointing jitter noise. Additionally, the ultra-precise laser interferometer needs to integrate the following functionalities: laser acquisition, laser ranging, laser communication, and clock synchronization. Conversely, the drag-free control system has the following three components: inertial sensor, micro-thruster, and drag-free controller. The inertial sensor is used to sense the displacement between the spacecraft and proof mass and send the signal to the drag-free controller. Further, the controller commands the micro-thruster to push the spacecraft to maintain the proof mass' position centered at the electrostatic cage of the inertial sensor. The space laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna is also a highly complex system in debt of the high degree of coupling between a subsystem and the high confusion of the enormous quantity of signals. An end-to-end numerical simulator might be essential in helping us understand the problems of data analysis, optimization of the configuration of the spacecraft and payload, and optimization of the mission design to solve the problem caused by complexity and to enhance the scientific output. Additionally, a more careful investigation of the levels 1 and 2 data analyses investigating the scientific impacts of the gravitational wave sources is also needed. The key problems of the abovementioned space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection missions are generally discussed. Moreover, a brief history of the space-borne laser interferometer gravitational wave detection missions, including LISA, which is the ESA-NASA joint space-borne gravitational wave antenna; Taiji, which is the space-borne gravitational wave mission proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences; and TianQin, which is a geocentric orbit space-borne gravitational wave mission raised by Sun Yat-sen University, is reviewed.

The spacebased gravitational wave detection is based on a long-distance laser interference device, which mainly detects gravitational wave signals in a frequency range of 0.1 mHz-1 Hz. The noise evaluation and noise suppression of the laser light source system directly affect the detection sensitivity. In this work, based on low-noise photoelectric detection, a very low-frequency laser intensity noise test and evaluation system is constructed with high-precision digital multimeter, software control and algorithm programming of the host computer. The laser intensity noise can be converted into the fluctuation of the current signal by utilizing the photodiode, and the current signal is converted into the voltage signal and amplified by the transimpedance circuit. Thus the highfrequency interference components are filtered out by a passive low-pass filtering, and the extremely lowfrequency noise components are retained. According to the definition of shot noise, it can be known that the photocurrent injected into the detector is inversely proportional to the shot noise, so at least 5 mW laser is chosen for photoelectric detection. After controlling the high-precision digital multimeter through LabVIEW software programming, the acquisition is detected. The output voltage signal by the laser is subjected to the fast Fourier transform and logarithmic frequency axis power spectral density estimation algorithm for noise evaluation in the frequency domain, forming a complete laser intensity noise evaluation and measurement system. The 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band laser intensity noise evaluation is finally obtained. The experimental results show that the noise of the high-precision multimeter in a frequency band of 0.1 mHz-1 Hz is lower than 5*10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2); the noise of the detector electronics ina frequency band of 0.1 mHz -1 Hz is lower than 4* 10~(-5) V/Hz~(1/2). The electronic noise of the high-precision multimeters and the detectors meet the requirements for space gravitational wave detection. The experimental results show that the 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band laser intensity noise evaluation system we built meets the needs of space-based gravitational wave detection program, and provides an important foundation for building a laser source that meets the needs of space-based gravitational wave detection."

It should be emphasized that the laser intensity noise and frequency noise should be suppressed in the laser source system of the interferometer. Moreover, as the first level device of laser noise characterization and suppression, the performance of photoelectric detection will directly affect the effect of laser noise suppression. First of all, on the basis of selecting low noise chip and high stable bias system, the whole circuit was designed by self-reducing circuit and transimpedance-amplifying circuit. In addition, in electromagnetic shielding, low temperature drift factor element, low noise power supply and active temperature control and other technical means, realize the development of high gain and low noise balanced homodyne detection system.

Telescopes play a crucial role in using transmitting and receiving laser beams measuring the constellation arms with heterodyne laser interferometry. The far-field phase noise induced by the coupling of the wavefront aberrations of optical telescopes with their pointing jitters is one of the major noise sources for the measurement. As phase noise suppression is a critical aspect for achieving the required comprehensive measuring stability, this paper theoretically analyzes the mechanism of the far-field phase noise, proposes an optimization strategy for the design of the optical telescopes in SGOs, and verifies it to pave the way for the comprehensive phase noise control in the design-to-manufacture process. Methods To analytically establish the relationship of the coupling coefficient with the aberrations in the form of polynomial expansions, the paper adopts the Fringe Zernike polynomials to represent the aberrations and further construct and describe the wavefront error. Then, the coupling coefficient defined as the modulus of the gradient of the far-field wavefront error is expressed as a polynomial function of the aberration coefficients and the tilt angles and is further simplified on the basis of the symmetry of the telescope. According to this relationship and the aberration characteristics of the telescope design residuals, the paper evaluates the effect of different aberrations on phase noise, revealing that defocus, primary astigmatism, and primary spherical aberration are the keys to controlling the coupling coefficient. Thus, an optimization strategy based on key aberration control is proposed. The performance of this method in far-field phase noise suppression is verified by examples of telescope design. Results and Discussions The wavefront quality of the telescopes before and after optimization (Table 1) by the above strategy is at the lambda/20 (lambda =1064 nm) level. Before optimization, the far-field wavefront changes significantly within the range of 100 nrad. Accordingly, the coupling coefficient increases rapidly with the tilt angle to over 1 pm/nrad. After optimization, although the wavefront residuals are slightly worse (Table 2), the range of far-field wavefront error decreases markedly by more than 90% (Fig. 4). The corresponding coupling coefficient is smaller than 0.11 pm/nrad within the range of 100 nrad. It is only 6% of that before optimization and much smaller than the required value (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the optimization strategy based on aberration control can effectively reduce the coupling coefficient of the far-field phase noise, even in the case of poor wavefront quality. Conclusions On the basis of theoretical analysis of the mechanism of the far-field phase noise, this paper determines the relationship of the coupling coefficient with the aberrations, develops an optimization strategy based on key aberration control, and verifies the strategy. The results reveal that suppressing the key aberrations deliberately instead of simply enhancing the demand for wavefront quality in the optimization process can reduce the sensitivity of the far-field phase to jitters more efficiently, improve the far-field phase stability of the telescope significantly, and balance the severe noise budget and the design freedom of the telescope to reserve sufficient margin for the rest optics."

Currently, low-noise spectrum analyzer is used for RIN testing in the higher frequency band of 50 kHz-5 GHz, and relevant theories and testing methods are relatively mature. OEWaves of the USA SYCATUS of Japan and Shanghai Institute of Optical Machinery have launched corresponding standard test instruments. However, the current test methods in the low-frequency band are limited in the test band or have high background noise, which cannot fully meet the requirements of RIN low frequency band test and evaluation of laser light source for space-based gravitational wave detection. It is necessary to develop the low background noise measurement technology and complete and accurate evaluation standard of all low frequency band. Methods In this study, the low-frequency RIN within 0.1 mHz - 100 kHz is completely tested and characterized, and the background noise of the test system is reduced to form a standardized test system and test algorithm. First, based on low-noise photodetector, high-precision digital multimeter, Labview control data acquisition, and data processing algorithm programming, the test characterization of laser RIN in the frequency band of 0.1 mHz - 0.5 Hz was realized. In the time domain, the high-precision acquisition was conducted using the Labview software to control DMM. The fast Fourier transform(FFT) algorithm was used to analyze the noise characteristics of the collected data in the frequency domain. The smoothing function of different resolutions was used in the calculation of RIN to ensure that the test results in the low-frequency band are not true, while the serious trailing phenomenon in the high-frequency band was reduced. Besides, frequency domain analysis can be performed immediately upon the completion of the time domain collection, and the data can be stored in real time. Combined with the data of different sampling time, the accuracy of the very-low-frequency test results was verified. Second, FFT spectrum analyzer(SR770, Stanford Research Systems) was used to test the RIN of laser in the frequency band of 1 mHz- 100 kHz. By adding low noise amplifier(LNA) into the test system, the background noise in the frequency band of 1 mHz-1 Hz was effectively reduced. The testing capacity was reduced by 18 dB. Finally, the consistency of the test results of the two test methods in the overlapping frequency band was compared to verify the uniformity and accuracy of the two test results. Finally, the low-background-noise RIN test band was expanded to 0.1 mHz-100 kHz. The RIN noise measurement system has the advantages of wide coverage of low-frequency band, high precision, and high accuracy. It can provide a standardized measurement means for the relative intensity noise of laser in space gravitational wave detection and can also be applied to other low-frequency precision measurement applications of laser light source noise assessment. Results and Discussions According to the sampling time listed in Table 3, data segments ranging from 10000 s to 8000 s are captured to calculate the laser very-low-frequency RIN, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the highfrequency tail after Smooth piecewise smoothing algorithm is only 2 dB; in the range of 0.04 Hz to 0.5 Hz, different data lengths have little influence on RIN results. However, in the frequency range of 0.1 mHz-0.04 Hz, the sampling time of 8000 s is significantly different from that of 10000 s, and more noise information can be detected at 80000 s. Moreover, Fig. 7 shows that the curves with the sampling time of 10000 s and 2000 s have poor coincidence compared with other long periods."

The detection of such signals will contribute to further research on BH physics and enhance our understanding of BH populations. However, such a GW source has not yet been detected and has not been widely considered in the current study. Therefore, it is important to research its detectability. Based on the numerical relativistic simulation, a recent study has given accurate waveforms for parabolic BH encounters. Using the GW burst search tool Minke, a large-scale data set is produced in the two-parameter spaces of total mass and distance, and the detection range was quantitatively calculated. The result shows that BH encounter is a potential candidate for current groundbased detectors. Finally, a focus question that how to distinguish the BH capture from a binary BH merger is discussed. Using the posterior distributions of the signal under the two samplers, a distinguishing method is proposed. By comparing different posteriors, it is found that there is a significant difference in the merger time t0 of the BH capture and binary BH merger signal, which contributes to distinguishing the two GW sources."

However, the hot big bang model still suffers from several puzzles, such as the flatness problem, the horizon problem, the unwanted relics and so on. The inflation model which was proposed by Alan Guth in the early of 1980s is an elegant paradigm which provides a simple solution to all of the problems in the hot big bang model. Due to the nearly exponential expansion of space during inflation, the initial spatial curvature and inhomogeneities are smoothed away. In this sense, a spatially flat universe can be taken as one of the key predictions of inflationary universe and it has been confirmed by a lot of cosmological observations. On the other hand, during inflation, the Universe is small and the quantum effects become significant. Actually, such quantum fluctuations will finally seed the formation of large-scale structure and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Because the Hubble parameter is roughly a constant during inflation, the power spectrum of the density perturbation generated by the quantum fluctuations is expected to be nearly scale-invariant. Actually, all of the current cosmological observations really prefer a Gaussian and nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum of density perturbations which is nicely consistent with the prediction of the simple inflation models. In addition, inflation also predicts that there should be primordial gravitational waves which generate the B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background. In the early of 2014, BICEP2 collaborations reported an excess of B-mode power over the based lensed standard cosmological model expectation at the cosmic scales. Unfortunately, it is finally confirmed to be the foreground contaminations, not originated from the primordial gravitational waves. Up to now, ones only set a restricted upper limit on the amplitude of primordial gravitational-wave power spectrum. Such a small upper limit implies that the inflation is driven by an effective cosmological constant at the leading order. In order for naturally ending inflation at a time in the early universe, there should be a dynamical term in the potential of inflation field as well. The precise measurement of the spectral index of scalar power spectrum from Planck satellite favors the so-called Starobinsky's inflation model which is driven by the R2 term adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, why the higher order corrections should be exponentially suppressed in the Starobinsky's inflation model is still an open question. In addition, if a contraction phase happened before the inflation, it may modify the primordial density perturbation power spectrum at very large scales and may help us to explain some hints of the anomalies on such scales."

We study the deep learning gravitational wave detection models with different convolution kernel sizes, convolution kernel number, and convolution layer number. In addition, we investigate the detection effect of the model with batch normalization before the fully connected layer, and find that the detection accuracy of the model with a single convolutional layer increase from about 50% to more than 90% when the batch normalization is applied. A potential new method is provided for the compression of the number of matched filtering templates. By adding BN and full connection layer after matching filter, the number of matching templates may be greatly reduced.

Gravitational waves will provide us with a powerful tool for investigating the physics of BBHs, because it encodes information about the formation channel of this system. However, Many physical properties of BBH system is still unknown, especially mass, spin and other intrinsic parameter distributions of binary system from different formation channels. Mass distribution of black holes from gravitational-wave detection and X-ray observation are different, because of different formational channels. X-ray observation indicates that the black hole mass distribute mainly in (7.8 1.2)M_⊙, which may come from dynamical capture. And mass estimation from gravitational waves is in the range 20M_⊙ 40M_⊙, which is supposed to be field BBHs. This is because Jeans stability analysis provides corresponding Jeans radius and black hole mass which is smaller than dynamical binaries. Two formation channels are commonly considered for BBH coalescence: common envelope evolution and dynamical evolution mechanism which have the underlying uncertain intrinsic parameter distributions on mass and spin. The two formation channels have different mass and spin distributions, and due to Jeans stability analysis, black hole mass from common envelope evolution is smaller than the other case and spin aligned. BBHs from dynamical capture mechanism have random oriented spins commonly considered as isotropic distribution. Based on differences especially mass and spin distributions of BBHs from the two formation channels, using Bayesian hierarchical inference to distinguish the two formation channels is workable, more over, Bayes method can be used to calculate relative population of sources in each channel.

It is currently in the commissioning stage and it will soon join LIGO and Virgo for the detection of gravitational waves. Adding KAGRA to the detectors network will increase the sky location accuracy of the gravitational wave source. The several special techniques used in KAGRA will generate new experience. The underground location of the detector will reduce the seismic noise and cryogenic operation will reduce the thermal noise. As a future upgrade of the ground-based gravitational wave interferometric detectors, the laser power and the mirror mass will increase. In this condition, the quantum noise will limit the sensitivity in all the detection frequency range. To reduce quantum noise in the next generation gravitational wave detectors, one of the most well-known quantum non-demolition techniques is the so-called frequency dependent squeezing.

The laser power becomes very small after being transmitted over millions of kilometers. Ultra-long distance, ultra-low power and high precision requirements make the laser link construction process of Taiji program a great challenge. In order to realize the networking of three satellites, the whole laser link construction process needs to establish three bidirectional laser links in turn. Space-based gravitational wave detection proposes a scheme to gradually build a bidirectional laser link by using three-level detectors of star tracker (STR), complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)capture camera and quadrant photodiode (QPD), and finally realize the ultra-stable laser pointing jitter control through the highprecision attitude information measured by the differential wavefront sensing (DWS)technology. At present, the scheme is in the stage of theoretical demonstration. In order to test the scheme, we adopt the laboratory's laser acquisition and pointing integrated optical system and a card based on a ZYNQ chip, and expect to realize autonomous control of the whole laser link construction process. Methods We use ground optical experiment to simulate the actual laser link construction progress between two satellites under the laboratory conditions. The whole experiment includes two optical benches which are actually realistic restoration of Taiji program acquisition and pointing light path (Fig. 3), and they are respectively mounted on two hexapod displacement tables to simulate the adjustment of satellite attitude. To fully simulate the whole progress of the actual laser link construction, the ground optical experiment is divided into four stages: initialization, coarse acquisition, fine acquisition and laser pointing. According to the scheme of laser link construction, we design the whole progress flow control, spiral scanning control, spot centroid location and closed-loop control by Verilog, and verify every module separately. And then we use ZYNQ card to control the whole experiment. Results and Discussions The experimental results show that the bidirectional laser link is successfully constructed in the atmospheric environment. Finally, corresponding to the wavefront of the actual system's telescope, the acquisition precision reaches 0.07 murad and the control accuracy of the final laser pointing control process reaches 9.7 nrad/ Hz in the sensitive frequency band of the Taiji program, which can meet the task requirements. The main influencing factors of the spot centroid control effect in the fine acquisition stage are the calibration error during the DWS calibration and the position error caused by the long-term drift of the manual four-axis displacement table. The internal stress change of the manual four-axis displacement table results in a large difference between the actual displacement table position and the position calibrated before the experiment in the pitch and yaw directions, which causes the position of the spot centroid during the experiment to deviate from the zero point of the hexapod displacement table. And the main factor affecting the control accuracy during the laser pointing stage is the background noise. By collecting the DWS data without controlling the hexapod displacement table when the platforms are aligned, it is found that the laser pointing precision is close to the background noise level (Fig. 13). Therefore, the background noise is the main noise source, which includes atmospheric fluctuation, temperature shift and environmental vibration."
"请用英文重写以下论文摘要：探测低频引力波需要脱离地缘噪声干扰,在空间搭建激光干涉引力波探测装置。太极、 LISA、天琴等空间引力波探测任务,计划在几十万到几百万公里量级的臂长上实现皮米级的位移测量精度,以满足引力波探测的要求。在探测任务中,考虑轨道季节性变化和星间激光传输时间等因素,发射光束需要一个超前角度,确保远端望远镜能够接收到光束,从而完成星间激光干涉。针对发射光束需要超前角度的需求,设计并研制了一款用于激光干涉链路中提供超前角度的光束指向机构,即超前瞄准机构。该机构基于将偏转轴配置在反射镜面上的设计理念,采用柔性铰链和杠杆配合的结构形式,利用压电陶瓷自闭环进行驱动控制,实现光束一维高精度偏转。对该机构进行仿真分析,验证其力学特性以及偏转范围。对所研制的机构进行了一系列实验测试,结果表明,该机构偏转范围可达到709.4 murad,偏转精度可达到0.44 murad,机构偏转引起的光程差优于10 pm/Hz (1~10 Hz)。从而验证了该机构设计的可行性,为实现光束超稳高精度偏转提供一定的参考。","Objective To detect low-frequency gravitational waves, it is necessary to eliminate the interference of geo-noise and build a laser interference gravitational wave detection device in space. Taiji, LISA, Tianqin and other space gravitational wave detection missions have been planning to achieve pm-sensitivity on the arm length of several million kilometers to meet the requirements of gravitational wave detection. Because of orbit evolution and time delay in the interferometer arms, the direction of transmitted laser beam changes, consequently, a remote telescope cannot receive the laser beam to complete the inter-satellite laser interference. Aiming at the need for the point ahead angle of the emission beam, a beam pointing mechanism that provides the point ahead angle in the laser interference link is designed and developed for the space gravitational wave detection device, called the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism. Methods Based on the design concept of aligning the rotary axis on the mirror surface, the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism employs the structural form of flexible hinges and lever (Fig.2), and the control scheme of piezoelectric ceramic self-closing loops to achieve one-dimensional high-precision beam rotation (Fig.3). Mechanical properties are verified by the simulation analysis (Fig.4-5). Rotary range of the mechanism is verified by the simulation analysis (Fig.6). Under the condition of normal temperature and pressure with a relative humidity of 60%, the rotary characteristic test is carried out by using an autocollimator (Fig.7). And under the conditions of normal temperature (24 ℃) and vacuum environment (less than 50 Pa), a special interferometer is built to test the optical path difference (Fig.9). Results and Discussions A series of experiments are conducted on the mechanism, and the results show that the rotary range of the mechanism is 709.4 murad, rotary accuracy is 0.44 murad, and the results meet the requirements (Fig.8). The optical path differences are better than 10 pm/Hz when the frequency is between 1 Hz and 10 Hz, and the results meet the requirement (Fig.10). But when the frequency was between 1 mHz and 1 Hz, the optical path differences are greater than 10 pm/Hz. After simulation analysis, they are mainly related to the influence of temperature changes in the experimental environment (Fig.11). This is also the direction of further research. In short, it is proven that the principal design of the mechanism is feasible, and it is a reasonable reference for achieving ultra-stable and high-precision beam rotation. Conclusions In this study, the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism for space gravitational wave detection is designed and developed, and the corresponding index tests are completed, which verify the rationality of the mechanism design. The mechanism is a one-dimensional and two-way rotation, the maximum rotary range can reach about 709.4 murad, and the rotary accuracy can reach about 0.44 murad, all of which meet the expected design requirements. When the frequency is between 1 Hz and 10 Hz, the optical path difference caused by the mechanism is better than 10 pm/Hz, and when the frequency is between 1 mHz and 1 Hz, the optical path difference is greater than 10 pm/Hz. The optical path difference of the Point Ahead Angle Mechanism developed in this paper still has a gap with the foreign advanced level and design requirements, and the mechanism needs to be optimized. At the same time, the influence of temperature on the optical path difference test should be considered in further research."

We used several probes (drag force, jet quenching parameter, heavy vector meson spectral function) to characterize the phase transition and studied gravitational waves from the holographic QCD phase transition in the early universe. We used different holographic QCD models to discuss the QCD phase transition, energy loss, spectral function, and gravitational waves. We found that the chemical potential and angular velocity changed the location of the critical endpoint, and the drag force and jet quenching parameter were temperature dependent and enhanced near the phase transition temperature. The magnetic field had a nontrivial effect on the spectral function. We conclude that the chemical potential decreases omega_c, and the angular velocity decreases mu_c and the phase transition temperature. The jet quenching parameter and drag force can characterize the phase transition, and the magnetic field promotes the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the energy density of gravitational waves decreases as the gluon condensate increases, and the peak frequency shifts downward with increasing gluon condensate. Exploring the phase structure of QCD is an important task in high-energy heavy ion collision physics, and recently, there has been considerable interest in the QCD phase transition for rotating backgrounds."

Highly sensitive to the amplitude and phase of the incident light, the BHD can reliably extract quantum fluctuations, suppress the classical common-mode noise, and amplify quantum fluctuations to the macro level. However, the performance of the BHD is limited by the bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the detector. The optimal design of the BHD has always been a research hotspot. The transimpedance circuit based on a direct current (DC) coupled circuit is not suitable for detecting quantum noise. The reason is that as the power of the incident light increases, the unbalanced DC increases rapidly, and the transimpedance amplifier is saturated, which significantly reduces the dynamic range of the BHD. The BHD based on an inductor-capacitor (L-C) coupled circuit generates higher electronic noise at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. It is not suitable for low-frequency measurements due to the parasitic effect of the inductor and the low impedance of the inductor at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. In this paper, the noise sources of the BHD are analyzed theoretically, and a resistor-capacitor (R-C) coupled transimpedance circuit is used to improve the performance of the BHD at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. Furthermore, the transimpedance circuit is optimized to increase the bandwidth to 200 MHz. The CMRR of the BHD is improved by designing a self-subtraction photodetector scheme, a variable optical attenuator, and an adjustable reverse bias voltage. These designs allow the BHD to meet the low-frequency and highfrequency measurements with high SNR and CMRR in quantum noise measurement. Methods To enable the BHD to measure both low-frequency and high-frequency signals with high sensitivity, this paper adopts the BHD based on an R-C coupled transimpedance circuit. Two photodiodes are connected in series, and the balanced current signal in the two photodiodes is divided into a DC signal and an alternating current (AC) signal by the R-C coupled structure. The AC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and is further used to measure the shot-noise power of the incident light. The DC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a load resistor and is then used to measure the balance between the two incident lights. To reduce the crosstalk between the DC circuit and the AC circuit, an isolation amplifier is added after the load resistor. An adjustable bias voltage (BV) circuit is used to adjust the junction capacitance of the photodiodes and further improve the CMRR. To compensate for the difference in the amplitude of the two photodiodes and thereby improve the CMRR of the BHD, the paper also utilizes a variable optical attenuator based on fiber bending, where variable attenuation is achieved by changing the radius of the bent fiber. The attenuation of the fiber is precisely adjusted to balance the photocurrent. In addition, an equivalent noise model is constructed. The electronic noise from the TIA circuit includes four parts, i. e., the noise introduced by the dark current in the photodiodes, the thermal noise in the feedback resistor, the noise generated by the input current noise in the TIA, and the noise produced by the input voltage noise. On the basis of theoretical analysis, reasonable DC load resistance and feedback capacitance, photodiodes with low dark current and low junction capacitance, and a TIA with low input noise are selected to reduce the electronic noise and improve the SNR of the BHD. Results and Discussions A BHD with an R-C coupled circuit structure is designed (Fig. 1)."

The displacement sensor, micro-controller and ESF are connected in a close-loop tuned by proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Constraining the pendulum within a small deflection, the force exerted by ESF equals the thrust loaded by solenoid as a replacement of micro-thrusters.

Achieving this requires a host of physical measurements that flow from sensors to computers. These measurements are analyzed, displayed and stored through a complexhardware and software system that are presented in this paper. Such a high precision measurement requires extremely sensitive experimental and dataanalysis techniques. The signal that continuously comes from a gravitational wave interferometer can be observed either as a function of time, or in the time-frequency domain, since this representation is adapted to the oscillatory nature of the gravitational waves. Differentdata analysis techniques are appropriate for each representation. For the time domain, we thus discuss matched filtering techniques, which can find a small signal of known form buriedin noise. The time-frequency domain is presented in conjunction with techniques used fordetecting bursts of gravitational waves, and unwanted glitches in the interferometer signal. Since multiple large gravitational wave interferometers are being made available, it is natural to take advantage of their conjoint measurements: a gravitational wave should be seen on all running detectors (with an amplitude that depends on their orientation), whereasglitches in the interferometer signal should generally not happen at the same time in the same way. This forms the basis of the coincidence and coherent data analysis methods presented here. Other important computing techniques such as Monte-Carlo calculationsand X~2 for detecting gravitational waves and estimating their parameters (direction of their source, etc.) are also presented."

This is one of the predictions from the general relativistic theory proposed by Einstein in 1916. So far, their existence has been proven indirectly by Taylor and Hulse's observation on the decay of the orbital period in the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16. Now the field of gravitational waves astronomy is inaugurated. The theory of gravitational radiation already makes an important contribution to the understanding of a lot of astronomical systems, such as binary neutron stars, cataclysmic variables, young neutron stars, low-mass X-ray binaries, and even the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation.

These signals have long timescales,ranging from several days to several years,and require theoretical waveforms with high accuracy. Moreover,some low-frequency GW sources have complicated configurations,such as large eccentricities and precession,which leads to a large parameter space of waveforms,and numerous templates are required. Therefore,comparing with ground-based GW detection,space-borne GW detection requires more efficiency and quality for most waveform templates.

Gravitational wave has no effect on the geodesics of a test particle, but it affects the relative motion between two nearby test particles. To measure gravitational wave and its polarizations, we need to study the geodesic deviation equation for two nearby test particles. Since only the electric part of the Riemann tensor Ri0 j0 appears in the geodesic deviation equation and it has six independent components, there are up to six possible polarization states in general metric theories of gravity. In terms of the electric part of the Riemann tensor, the six polarizations are defined as follows. P_+ = -R_(x0x0)+ R_(y0y0) corresponds to the + mode, P_*= 2R_(x0y0) denotes the * mode, P_b = R_(x0x0)+ R_(y0y0) corresponds to the breathing mode, P_x = R_(x0z0) corresponds to the vector-x mode, P_x = R_(y0z0) represents to the vector-y mode, and Pl = Rz0z0 denotes the longitudinal mode. For weak, plane and null gravitational waves, these six polarizations can be classified based on their properties under the Lorentz transformation. In Einsteins general relativity, the gravitational waves are tensor waves and there are + and * modes of polarization. In Brans-Dicke theory, in addition to the + and * polarization states, the scalar breathing mode also appears, and all these three polarizations are transverse modes. In the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, the massive scalar field excites both the breathing and the longitudinal modes, so in addition to the + and * polarizations, there exists a single mix state consisting of both the breathing and the longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the longitudinal mode disappears and the mix state becomes the pure transverse breathing polarization as that in Brans-Dicke theory. The nonlinear f (R) theory of gravity can be written as a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, so the polarization states in f (R) gravity are the same as those in Horndeski theory except that there is no massless limit in f (R) gravity. In Einstein-Aether theory, due to the existence of the unit timelike vector field, the local Lorentz invariance is violated. The gravitational waves propagate with speeds different from the speed of light, and there are five independent polarization states, the + state P_+, the * state P_*, the vector-x state P_x, the vector-y state P_y and the mix state consisting of both the breathing and the longitudinal modes excited by the scalar field. In TeVeS theory, the local Lorentz invariance is also broken, so the gravitational waves in TeVeS theory propagate with speeds different from the speed of light. There are six polarization states in TeVeS theory, P_+, P_*, P_x, P_y and two mix states excited by the two scalar fields. Each of the mix states consists of both the breathing and the longitudinal modes. Because gravitational waves have different polarization states for different theories of gravity, the measurement of polarizations is a powerful tool in probing the nature of gravity."

Gravitational waves theory and their detection are becoming more and more interesting research areas for the theoretical and experiential physicists. In fact, with the development of science and technology, the humans have the ability to construct such sensitive ground-based and upcoming spaced detectors to observe gravitational waves(GWs) directly. LIGO claimed that we have detected the GWs firstly on September 14, 2015, and this signal originated from the event of the merger phase of binary black holes, since then we opened the prelude to GWs astronomy. The inspirals and mergers of compact binaries are among the most promising events for ground-based gravitational wave observatories. The detection of GWs and their electromagnetic (EM) signals from these sources would provide complementary information to each other. However, it is too hard to dig out the signal confidently and to localize the sources accurately.

In this thesis, we study the network of gravitational wave detectors and their localization performance. Firstly, we introduce the case of localization of GW150914 source. Then we show two general estimated methods of sources localization accuracy, namely, Monte-Carlo methods and analytical expression. In the end of this thesis, we will investigate the localization ability of the gravitational wave detectors networks which comprised of Chinese, Japanese, Australian detectors.

As the most common device used for space and ground-based gravitational wave detection, large-scale laser interferometer requires a low-noise laser as a beam source. The noise of the laser can be suppressed by utilizing the optoelectronic negative-feedback noise reduction technology to improve the sensitivity of large-scale laser interferometer. The optoelectronic negative-feedback control system can suppress laser noise by subtracting the photodetector signal from the voltage reference signal, and then calculating the modulated signal by a proportional integral differentiator to control the output power of the pump current driver. Since the photodetector signal is affected by the laser intensity, its output voltage varies within a certain range, which requires that the output voltage of the voltage reference source signal is variable. In addition, the performance of the voltage reference directly affects the overall performance of the feedback control loop, therefore it is the lower limit of laser noise suppression. We develop a high-precision lownoise program-controlled voltage reference by selecting low-noise reference chip and digital-to-analog conversion chip, designing external control circuit, using low-temperature drift coefficient components and using temperature control and electromagnetic shielding. The digital-to-analog conversion is controlled through the FPGA module programming to accurately realize the reference voltage change. The output voltage range of the developed voltage reference source is from negative 10 V to positive 10 V and the minimal precision of the voltage variation is 20 bit. The voltage noise spectral density of the developed voltage reference is below 9.6 * 10~(-6)/Hz and the noise performance of the reference source is less than the laser intensity noise in the space-based gravitational wave frequency band. The developed voltage reference source provides an important technical support for laser intensity noise suppression in gravitational wave detection."

They dominate the evolution and operation of the universe in the form of waves. Gravitational wave detection has been widely used by many scholars at home and abroad and has achieved breakthrough results. Gravitational wave detection is one of the most concerned frontiers of scientific research in the history of contemporary physics. Space laser heterodyne interferometer is a key component of gravitational wave detection system. The four-quadrant detector is an important part of the laser interference gravitational wave detector, which can be used for spot position detection, laser angle measurement, data transmission and reception, etc. The performance of the four-quadrant detector will directly affect the accuracy of the gravitational wave detector. Influenced by noise factors, the system signal-to-noise ratio(SNR)of laser interference gravitational wave detector and other parameters will be affected, thus affecting the detection accuracy and performance of the system. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a complete mathematical model for the position detection process of the four-quadrant detector and verify it through the simulation system, so as to analyze the factors affecting the position detection accuracy and improve the detection method. Methods In order to analyze the factors that affect the position detection accuracy of the four-quadrant detector, in this paper, firstly, the noise factors in the laser heterodyne interferometer and the relationship between the local oscillator power and the system SNR are analyzed. The mathematical theoretical model of the four-quadrant detector position detection is established, and the main factors affecting the position detection accuracy are theoretically derived. Then the position detection simulation system is established by using Monte Carlo random simulation method, and the Monte Carlo random points are used to characterize the receiving and solving process of the four-quadrant detector spot. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the theoretical results of the mathematical model, and the correctness and accuracy of the simulation results are verified. Results and Discussions The simulation system of four-quadrant detector position detection model based on Monte Carlo method is established. The simulation system is based on the Monte Carlo idea and consists of three parts: the Gaussian spot generation process, the spot center position calculation process, and the error evaluation process(Fig. 4). The estimated spot center position is compared with the true value to judge the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation method(Fig. 5). The simulation results show that due to the correlation of beat frequency signal noise among the four quadrants, the position detection accuracy is not affected by beat frequency signal noise(Fig. 6). Due to the independence of detector noise in the four quadrants, when the system SNR caused by detector noise rises from 30 dB to 44 dB, the position detection accuracy is improved(Fig. 7). The smaller the Gaussian spot radius is, the more concentrated the spot energy is, and the higher the position detection accuracy is(Fig. 8). The closer the spot center position is to the center of the four-quadrant detector photosensitive surface, the higher the position detection accuracy is(Fig. 9). Conclusions In this paper, the mathematical model of the position detection accuracy of the four-quadrant detector is studied theoretically and verified by the Monte Carlo simulation system. The key parameters that affect the position detection accuracy are obtained: system SNR, Gaussian spot radius and spot center position."

Since the first direct observation of GWs in 2015, more and more binary black hole mergers and neutron star merger were detected by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory(LIGO) and the Virgo interferometric detector. The construction of the third-generation(3G) gravitational wave detector(GWD), whose sensitivity is ten times that of the second-generation(2G) GWD(Advanced LIGO and Virgo), can not only push the gravitational wave astronomy towards the edge of the observable universe, but also test the fundamental laws of physics and study the nature of matter. By utilizing the abandoned underground mines, Shanxi university proposes to construct a 3G ground-based gravitational wave detector with an arm length of 10 km and a strain sensitivity of 10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2), improving the location accuracy of wave source by participating in the global GWD network. The construction of 3G GWD has many technical challenges, including ultrahigh large-scale vacuum system, ultrastable seismic isolation system, highprecision control system, high-quality laser and quantum source. Theoretically, the sensitivity of GWD with equal arm length is not limited by the laser source noise. However, in the actual scenario, the sensitivity is limited by the differences in arm length, arm cavity linewidth, arm reflectivity, arm mass, arm power, and the laser parameters. In this work, based on the design sensitivity(10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2)) of dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer, we propose the requirements for an ultra low-noise laser, including wavelength, amplitude noise, frequency noise, beam pointing noise and fundamental mode purity. The results show that in order to achieve the design sensitivity at the Fourier frequency of 100 Hz, the wavelength of the laser source should be 1.5 mum, the output power should be higher than 200 W, the amplitude noise should be better than 10-8 Hz~(-1/2), and the frequency noise should be better than 100 Hz/Hz1/2. To achieve the sensitivity of 10~(-24) Hz~(-1/2) at 10 Hz analysis frequency, the requirements for the amplitude and frequency noise of the laser source are much more stringent. This study lays a solid foundation for the analysis of laser source noise and the decomposition of interferometer indexes."

The theoretical model played an important role in the data analysis. The model not only extracts the signal enveloped in the detector noise, but also recognizes that the source is a binary-black-hole merger. Besides the ground-based detectors like LIGO, pulsar timing arrays and space-based detectors detect gravitational wave in different frequency band. Soon the FAST telescope will partly serve for pulsar timing arrays in the coming year. In the near future, SKA project will strongly enhance the gravitational wave detection with pulsar timing array. Regarding to the space-based detectors, eLISA project is going on in Europe. And the LISA pathfinder works quite well which implies that most instrument techniques for eLISA are ready. Besides eLISA, there are two more plans for space-based detectors in China including Taiji and Tianqin. Among all of these gravitational wave detection projects, theoretical models are very important for signal extraction and parameters inversion. Along the development of the gravitational wave astronomy, the theoretical model research becomes more and more important and urgent. Binary compact objects are among the most important and the most realistic gravitational wave sources for all the above mentioned gravitational wave detection projects. We briefly describe the research status of theoretical models for binary compact objects in this paper. Post Newtonian method, perturbation theory of black hole and numerical relativity are all introduced. Typically these three methods are applied to the inspiral, ringdown and merger stage respectively. And more we also introduced effective one body method which combines the results of all these three methods and constructs a full model for the whole inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) process. This model is called effective one body numerical relativity (EOBNR) model which is essential in the data analysis of GW150914. Currently, post Newtonian method has achieved 4 PN order for the conservative dynamics and 3.5 PN order for gravitational radiation part. Unfortunately the PN order is less for spinning black holes. With higher PN order, ones expect the description is more accurate, and it is valid for nearer separated binary compact objects. Perturbation theory for black holes includes two formalisms. One is metric perturbation which corresponds to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. One is curvature perturbation which corresponds to the Teukolsky equation. For Schwarzschild black hole these two formalisms are equivalent. The analytical solution to the Teukolsky equation is not clear yet. In most applications, ones use numerical methods to treat the Teukolsky equation. After the merger of two black holes, the space-time can always be looked as a perturbation of a Kerr black hole. This stage corresponds to the ringdown. So the ringdown stage can always be treated by perturbation theory. In addition, if the masses of the two black hole are extremely different, the effect of the small black hole can be treated as a perturbation to the big black hole. Different to the ringdown description, ones have to care about the motion of the small black hole which is affected by the back reaction of the gravitational wave. In addition, ones need to consider the Teukolsky equation with source. Differently in ringdown case, ones need only care about the initial state of the Teukolsky equation which is determined by the binary merger."

It opens a new window for human to observe our Universe and initiates the age of Gravitational Wave Astronomy. The data analysis of gravitational wave detection is a typically signal extraction problem and the matched filtering technique has shown to be an optimal method in extracting weak signal buried in strong Gaussian noises. Matched filtering requires the accurate gravitational waveforms. It is also essential for the parameter estimation of the gravitational wave source, with which the GW150914 was recognized as a binary of 29 and 36 solar masses black holes merging about 1.3 billion light years away. Nowadays, other laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as Virgo, KAGRA and the third LIGO in the India, IndIGO, are under construction.

The pulsar timing approach with FAST, SKA and other radio telescope arrays to detect gravitational wave are also in the rapid development. It is foreseeable the gravitational wave astronomy in the wide frequency band from 10~(-10) to 1000 Hz will be realized in the near future. As such, the matched filtering plays an important role, and correspondingly the theoretical research of gravitational wave source models becomes urgent and important. For astrophysical realistic objects without symmetries in general, the analytical treatment of Einstein equation becomes nearly intractable. The numerical relativity then becomes an essential method and tool for solving the Einstein equation.

This slight excess of the baryonic matter is a key input to the big bang nucleosynthesis and therefore is responsible for the generation of the light elements in the early universe and finally the formation of stars and galaxies at a later time. This excess has been measured in several different ways. In particular, the value of this number has been precisely measured from studies of the temperature an-isotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation by the Planck collaboration. Despite the concordance of the experimental measurements of this excess from different independent studies, none of the theoretical explanation of this problem is satisfactory and well accepted. The theoretical explanations of the baryon asymmetry are reviewed in this article. While there are many baryogenesis mechanisms, we focus on the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis, which is a highly testable scenario and is within the reach of current high energy colliders. The physical picture of the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis is then discussed. This is an interdisciplinary research area closely related to cosmology and the fundamental theory governing the particle physics. Therefore solutions to this cosmological problem may shed light on the searches for new physics governing particle interactions at the high energy frontier as well as the low energy intensity frontier. In particular, the necessity of going beyond the standard model of particle physics is discussed, due to the incapability of the standard model to generate the observed baryon asymmetry, with the solution of resorting to new physics capable of incorporating a new source of CP-violation and a Higgs potential that can accommodate a strongly first order electroweak phase transition. These requirements call for new particle interactions beyond the standard model and therefore can provide additional insight on new physics searches at high energy colliders and low energy precision measurements such as the searches for electric dipole moments of electrons, neutrons, protons and atoms. Also briefly discussed is the physical opportunities associated with the stochastic gravitational waves generated from a first order electroweak phase transition, which is another emerging window for probing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore can provide another independent test of the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis. The possibility of primordial black hole formation from the first order phase transition, which can serve as a non-particle candidate for the dark matter, and its possible detection with gravitational waves is also briefly introduced."

For the scalar type of perturbations Fst the resulting approximate analytical polarization is betas～--CFs(taud)△taud, where taud , and △taud are the decoupling time and the decoupling duration, respectively, and C approx= (0.08~ 0.12) depending on recombination models. For the tensorial type of perturbations, the calcula-tion is a bit more complicated, and we do it in the long wave-length limit. By expanding the perturbation function in terms of the wave number and keeping the first two terms FT～-F(1)T+F(2)T, we integrate and obtain the analytic expressions for the polarizations, betaT～--[CF(1)T(taud)+DF(2)T(taud)]△taud where D approx= (0.22 ~ 0.32), also depending on recom-bination models. Our results may help to interpret the observed temperature-polarization cross correlation, and to disentangle the contribution by relic gravitational waves from that by density perturbations to the polarization and temperature anisotropies of CMB."

The detector is composed of three spacecraft forming an equilateral triangle configuration. The configuration of the detector is unstable due to the orbit error and perturbation. It is assumed that an ideal spacecraft is running in nominal orbit, and the real spacecraft in actual orbit forms a virtual formation with the ideal spacecraft. The three spacecraft of detector form three virtual formations with their ideal spacecraft. Considering the stability requirement of detector configuration and the effect of perturbation, the configuration of the virtual formation is designed to solve the correction value of mean orbital elements of spacecraft.
